<a name='002' href='../../xr/1Chron/013/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If <i>it seem</i> good unto you, and <i>that it be</i> of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, <i>that are</i> left in all the land of Israel, and with them <i>also</i> to the priests and Levites <i>which are</i> in their cities <i>and</i> suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1Chron/013/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1Chron/013/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1Chron/013/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.<br>
<a name='006' href='../../xr/1Chron/013/006.html' target='xr'>6.</a> And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, <i>that is</i>, to Kirjathjearim, which <i>belonged</i> to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth <i>between</i> the cherubims, whose name is called <i>on it</i>.<br>
<a name='007' href='../../xr/1Chron/013/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1Chron/013/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> And David and all Israel played before God with all <i>their</i> might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1Chron/013/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1Chron/013/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1Chron/013/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1Chron/013/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God <i>home</i> to me?<br>
