<a name='001' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/001.html' target='xr'>1.</a> Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.<br>
<a name='002' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.<br>
<a name='006' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/006.html' target='xr'>6.</a> And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and <i>to</i> Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think <i>of men</i> above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.<br>
<a name='007' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> For who maketh thee to differ <i>from another</i>? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive <i>it</i>, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received <i>it</i>?<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> We <i>are</i> fools for Christ's sake, but ye <i>are</i> wise in Christ; we <i>are</i> weak, but ye <i>are</i> strong; ye <i>are</i> honourable, but we <i>are</i> despised.<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:<br>
<a name='013' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/013.html' target='xr'>13.</a> Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, <i>and are</i> the offscouring of all things unto this day.<br>
<a name='014' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/014.html' target='xr'>14.</a> I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn <i>you</i>.<br>
<a name='015' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/015.html' target='xr'>15.</a> For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet <i>have ye</i> not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.<br>
<a name='016' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/016.html' target='xr'>16.</a> Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.<br>
<a name='017' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/017.html' target='xr'>17.</a> For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.<br>
<a name='018' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/018.html' target='xr'>18.</a> Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.<br>
<a name='019' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/019.html' target='xr'>19.</a> But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.<br>
<a name='020' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/020.html' target='xr'>20.</a> For the kingdom of God <i>is</i> not in word, but in power.<br>
<a name='021' href='../../xr/1Cor/004/021.html' target='xr'>21.</a> What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and <i>in</i> the spirit of meekness?<br>
