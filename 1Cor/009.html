<a name='001' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/001.html' target='xr'>1.</a> Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?<br>
<a name='002' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> Have we not power to eat and to drink?<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and <i>as</i> the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?<br>
<a name='006' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/006.html' target='xr'>6.</a> Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?<br>
<a name='007' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> Or saith he <i>it</i> altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, <i>this</i> is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> If we have sown unto you spiritual things, <i>is it</i> a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> If others be partakers of <i>this</i> power over you, <i>are</i> not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.<br>
<a name='013' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/013.html' target='xr'>13.</a> Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live <i>of the things</i> of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?<br>
<a name='014' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/014.html' target='xr'>14.</a> Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.<br>
<a name='015' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/015.html' target='xr'>15.</a> But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for <i>it were</i> better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.<br>
<a name='016' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/016.html' target='xr'>16.</a> For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!<br>
<a name='017' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/017.html' target='xr'>17.</a> For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation <i>of the gospel</i> is committed unto me.<br>
<a name='018' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/018.html' target='xr'>18.</a> What is my reward then? <i>Verily</i> that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.<br>
<a name='019' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/019.html' target='xr'>19.</a> For though I be free from all <i>men</i>, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.<br>
<a name='020' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/020.html' target='xr'>20.</a> And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;<br>
<a name='021' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/021.html' target='xr'>21.</a> To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.<br>
<a name='022' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/022.html' target='xr'>22.</a> To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all <i>men</i>, that I might by all means save some.<br>
<a name='023' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/023.html' target='xr'>23.</a> And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with <i>you</i>.<br>
<a name='024' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/024.html' target='xr'>24.</a> Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.<br>
<a name='025' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/025.html' target='xr'>25.</a> And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they <i>do it</i> to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.<br>
<a name='026' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/026.html' target='xr'>26.</a> I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:<br>
<a name='027' href='../../xr/1Cor/009/027.html' target='xr'>27.</a> But I keep under my body, and bring <i>it</i> into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.<br>
