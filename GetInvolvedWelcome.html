It is our desire to foster a community of active EPP users that make
suggestions, find errors and in general. We are already
indebted to many of our users for sending us excellent
suggestions. Many such suggestions have been incorporated into this and other product releases.<br><br>
For those who are interested in getting involved, please let us know. We would
love to have your help! The <a href="GetInvolvedParticipate.html" target="HiMain">participate</a>
link lists only a few ideas, but many more forms of synergy are possible.
Please do not hesitate to contact us.<br><br>
Thank you!
