<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">Correct ideas on the subject of a sinner's justification are exceedingly important; because this is a cardinal point in the Christian system. A mistake here will be apt to extend its pernicious influence to every other important doctrine. There is in human nature a strong tendency to build on a false foundation; because man, when created, was placed under a covenant of works; and, by nature, he knows no other way, than "do and live." [<i>cf</i>. <a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/Gen/042.html#018' target='kj'>Gen</a> <a href='../../../xr/Gen/042/018.html' target='xr'>42:18</a>] Human reason and the dictates of conscience, urge men to seek the favour of God by obeying his will. If we were able to render to the law such an obedience as would secure justification, this would still be the right way, and no other need be sought. "If there had been a law," says Paul, "which could have given life, verily righteousness (or justification) should have been by the law." [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/Gal/003.html#021' target='kj'>Gal</a> <a href='../../../xr/Gal/003/021.html' target='xr'>3:21</a>] "But what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, [<a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/Rom/008.html#003' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/008/003.html' target='xr'>8:3</a>-4] who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit." [<a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/Rom/008.html#001' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/008/001.html' target='xr'>8:1</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">In most cases we should think it unnecessary and <a name='g10010' href='../../../rf/gl/i.html#inexpedient' target='gl'>inexpedient</a> to contend about the meaning of a word, when they who used it, explained the sense in which they take it; but, here it is exceedingly important, to ascertain the scriptural meaning of the word <i>justification</i>;</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='121'>121</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">for this is the point from which men's opinions are most apt to diverge from the dictates of divine revelation. And if we put a wrong sense on the word, it will be sure to favour the dangerous doctrine of human merit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">We would, therefore, lay it down as a truth, capable of the clearest proof, that justification, as used in Scripture, does not mean any change wrought within us, but a change of our relation or standing under the law. As condemnation does not signify the making a man wicked, but declaring him guilty; so justification, which is the very opposite of condemnation, does not mean the infusion of holiness or justice into the hearts of men; but, it is the sentence of a judge, declaring that the person to whom it appertains, is acquitted from every charge, and stands right in the view of the law. It is then the act of the Judge of the universe, by which it is declared, that all condemnation is removed, and that the sinful man is accepted as righteous in the eye of the law. It is evident, that there can be no justification by any law, unless the person accused can plead a perfect righteousness; for if he has sinned but once, that one sin will prevent his justification as certainly as a thousand. After Adam had committed the first sin, it was impossible he should ever be justified by his own works. And thus the word is used in regard to human laws. If a man is arraigned before any just tribunal, and it is proved that he has committed one felonious act, the judge cannot justify him. And hence it appears evident to reason, and the same thing is repeatedly and emphatically taught in Scripture, "that by the deeds of the law no man can be justified in the sight of God." [<a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/Rom/003.html#020' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/003/020.html' target='xr'>3:20</a>; <a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/Gal/003.html#011' target='kj'>Gal</a> <a href='../../../xr/Gal/003/011.html' target='xr'>3:11</a>] And the reason simply is, that no man's obedience to the law is perfect.</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='122'>122</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">The idea entertained by some, that a sinner's imperfect obedience may be the ground of justification, is, therefore, evidently absurd. And the opinion, that the moral law is changed, and so relaxed as to be level to the capacity of sinful creatures, is false and <a name='g10020' href='../../../rf/gl/u.html#unscriptural' target='gl'>unscriptural</a>, and tends to introduce another gospel, entirely subversive of the true system of salvation. Man's sincere obedience, though imperfect, may be an evidence that he is in a justified state, but never can be the ground of the sentence of the Judge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The question then returns, "How can any man be just with God, since all have sinned and come short of the glory of God?" [<a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/Rom/003.html#023' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/003/023.html' target='xr'>3:23</a>] To which we answer, that a man under the gospel is justified by faith, without the deeds of the law; that is, he is justified by the perfect righteousness of Christ, received by faith. This righteousness is imputed to the believing sinner; that is, God treats him as if he himself had wrought it out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">God, the Judge, views the sinner, considered, in his own character, as he is, chargeable with innumerable transgressions of his holy law; but, when this ungodly man truly believes and becomes united to Christ, he imputes to him the perfect righteousness of his Surety, who has, in his stead, obeyed the precept and suffered the penalty of the law; and thus rendered a complete satisfaction to both law and justice. He can, therefore, be just, while he justifies the ungodly; for the sentence is not pronounced on the ground of any righteousness which the believing sinner has of his own, but entirely on the ground of the perfect righteousness of the Mediator, which is accepted, as though it had been rendered by himself. And in this transaction there is no erroneous judgment; for the Judge sees every thing as it is, and pardons the sinner and accepts his person,</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='123'>123</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">because he is viewed, "not having his own righteousness, which is of the law, but the righteousness which is of the faith of Christ; even the righteousness which is of God by faith." [<a name='s10070' href='../../../kj/Phil/003.html#009' target='kj'>Phil</a> <a href='../../../xr/Phil/003/009.html' target='xr'>3:9</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Some are willing to admit that the forgiveness of sin is on account of the atonement of Christ; but they are strongly opposed to the idea, that Christ's actual obedience to the law should be the ground of the believer's being adjudged to eternal life. But, if this be excluded, then the believer's own obedience must be the ground on which he receives life. But, here again, its imperfection renders it impossible that it should entitle him to any reward, much less to the reward of eternal life. The Scriptures, however, settle this dispute. Paul says, "As by the disobedience of one, many were made sinners; so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous." [<a name='s10080' href='../../../kj/Rom/005.html#019' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/005/019.html' target='xr'>5:19</a>] Christ is, by the prophet, emphatically called, "<i>The Lord our righteousness</i>." [<a name='s10090' href='../../../kj/Jer/023.html#006' target='kj'>Jer</a> <a href='../../../xr/Jer/023/006.html' target='xr'>23:6</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">This is charged upon the Jews as their fatal mistake, "that they went about to establish a righteousness of their own, and did not submit unto the righteousness of God." [<a name='s10100' href='../../../kj/Rom/010.html#003' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/010/003.html' target='xr'>10:3</a>] And it is then declared, that "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth." [<a name='s10110' href='../../../kj/Rom/010.html#004' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/010/004.html' target='xr'>10:4</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">As it is said, "that faith is imputed for righteousness," [<a name='s10120' href='../../../kj/James/002.html#023' target='kj'>James</a> <a href='../../../xr/James/002/023.html' target='xr'>2:23</a>] many have adopted the opinion, that the act of faith is graciously accepted, instead of a legal righteousness. But this would be inconsistent with the scope of the apostle, whose main object is to show that justification is entirely gratuitous, on account of Christ's merit; but faith is as much our act and our work, as any thing else; and, if a man is justified by his own faith, then boasting is no more excluded, than when he seeks justification by many good acts. Besides, the Judge of all cannot declare, that the mere act of faith</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='124'>124</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">answers all the demands of the law. Therefore, when it is said, that faith is imputed for righteousness, it must relate to the object of faith, even the perfect righteousness of Christ. If a condemned criminal should be pardoned by his prince, on account of the intercession of his own son, when the pardon is offered, the man gladly accepts it. This act of acceptance may be said to save him from death; but, the true ground of his deliverance is the intercession of the prince. In this way, as a mere instrument, faith justifies the sinner, and is imputed for righteousness, because it lays hold of and appropriates the righteousness of God, by which the law of God has been completely satisfied.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Others, considering faith as the root of every Christian virtue, and the spring of all good works, adopt the opinion, that to be justified by faith is the same as to be justified by our whole evangelical obedience, and that the works excluded by Paul, are either ceremonial observances, or "dead works," [<i>cf</i>. <a name='s10130' href='../../../kj/Heb/006.html#001' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/006/001.html' target='xr'>6:1</a>; <a name='s10140' href='../../../kj/Heb/009.html#014' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/009/014.html' target='xr'>9:14</a>] not proceeding from faith. To this theory the same objection lies, as has been already urged; namely, that this righteousness is imperfect, and no imperfect righteousness can justify. And another objection, which is fatal to this theory, is, that the sinner is justified completely when he first believes; "There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus;" [<a name='s10150' href='../../../kj/Rom/008.html#001' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/008/001.html' target='xr'>8:1</a>] "being justified freely by his grace;" [<a name='s10160' href='../../../kj/Rom/003.html#024' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/003/024.html' target='xr'>3:24</a>] "being justified by faith." [<a name='s10170' href='../../../kj/Rom/005.html#001' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/005/001.html' target='xr'>5:1</a>] But, if evangelical obedience is the ground of justification, no man can be justified in this life, for he will be engaged in working out this righteousness all his life. This consequence being inevitable, a learned commentator maintains, that there is no justification till the day of judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">There is nothing more difficult than to bring men</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='125'>125</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">off from dependence, in some form, on their own righteousness. Therefore, the advocates of human merit, and justification by works, have seized with avidity upon the words of the apostle James, who declares that "a man is justified by works and not by faith alone." [<a name='s10180' href='../../../kj/James/002.html#024' target='kj'>James</a> <a href='../../../xr/James/002/024.html' target='xr'>2:24</a>] If he used the words "faith" and "justification" in the same sense as that in which they are used by Paul, there would be a flat contradiction between these two apostles. Thus Luther viewed the matter, at first, and, therefore, for a while, rejected the epistle of James. But, when the scope of this apostle is considered, and the whole discourse impartially weighed, it will be found, that in doctrine he and Paul did not disagree, though they employ the terms mentioned in a somewhat different sense. James was engaged in refuting the opinion of certain professors, who held that all that was necessary to justification was a speculative assent to the truth. He shows that such a faith, being dead, could not justify. His doctrine is, that a living, operative faith, is necessary; and, that our faith must be shown by our works; and this is the same thing which Paul taught. Moreover, he uses the word justification, in the passage referred to, not for a sinner's acceptance with God, at first, but by it he means that which showed his sincerity; those good works which the saints perform justify them in the eyes of men; and this is evident from the example of Abraham, for he asks, Was not Abraham justified by works, when he offered up his son? But the pious act of offering up Isaac, took place many years after God had accepted Abraham, and entered into covenant with him. This act, therefore, could not have been the ground of his justification in the sight of God; but it justified the sincerity of his profession, and showed that he was indeed a true believer. These apostles,</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='126'>126</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">therefore, do not differ, but essentially agree in their doctrine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">By an impartial consideration of all the schemes of justification which have been devised, there is none which gives due honour to the divine law, except that which represents the righteousness of Christ imputed and received by faith, as the only ground of a sinner's pardon and acceptance. And, if God could have been just, and could have justified the sinner on any other ground, the whole <a name='g10030' href='../../../rf/gl/m.html#mediatorial' target='gl'>Mediatorial</a> work of Christ might have been dispensed with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">A common objection to this doctrine of gratuitous justification is, that it tends to negligence and licentiousness. This objection is as old as the time of Paul, for he states it distinctly and answers it <a name='g10040' href='../../../rf/gl/e.html#effectually' target='gl'>effectually</a>. "Do we make void the law through faith? nay we establish the law." [<a name='s10190' href='../../../kj/Rom/003.html#031' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/003/031.html' target='xr'>3:31</a>] "Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid! how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?" [<a name='s10200' href='../../../kj/Rom/006.html#001' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/006/001.html' target='xr'>6:1</a>-2] The faith which justifies, works by love and purifies the heart, therefore the justified person cannot be negligent of good works. And, if an appeal be made to facts, it will be found that those who maintain this doctrine, are not deficient in obedience, on a comparison with those who hold a different doctrine.</p>
