<a name='001' href='../../xr/1Cor/005/001.html' target='xr'>1.</a> It is reported commonly <i>that there is</i> fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.<br>
<a name='002' href='../../xr/1Cor/005/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1Cor/005/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, <i>concerning</i> him that hath so done this deed,<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1Cor/005/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1Cor/005/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.<br>
<a name='006' href='../../xr/1Cor/005/006.html' target='xr'>6.</a> Your glorying <i>is</i> not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?<br>
<a name='007' href='../../xr/1Cor/005/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1Cor/005/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened <i>bread</i> of sincerity and truth.<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1Cor/005/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1Cor/005/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1Cor/005/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1Cor/005/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?<br>
<a name='013' href='../../xr/1Cor/005/013.html' target='xr'>13.</a> But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.<br>
