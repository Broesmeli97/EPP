<a name='001' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/001.html' target='xr'>1.</a> And <i>David</i> made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.<br>
<a name='002' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:<br>
<a name='006' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/006.html' target='xr'>6.</a> Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:<br>
<a name='007' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> And said unto them, Ye <i>are</i> the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, <i>both</i> ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto <i>the place that</i> I have prepared for it.<br>
<a name='013' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/013.html' target='xr'>13.</a> For because ye <i>did it</i> not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.<br>
<a name='014' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/014.html' target='xr'>14.</a> So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.<br>
<a name='015' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/015.html' target='xr'>15.</a> And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.<br>
<a name='016' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/016.html' target='xr'>16.</a> And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren <i>to be</i> the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.<br>
<a name='017' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/017.html' target='xr'>17.</a> So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;<br>
<a name='018' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/018.html' target='xr'>18.</a> And with them their brethren of the second <i>degree</i>, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.<br>
<a name='019' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/019.html' target='xr'>19.</a> So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, <i>were appointed</i> to sound with cymbals of brass;<br>
<a name='020' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/020.html' target='xr'>20.</a> And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;<br>
<a name='021' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/021.html' target='xr'>21.</a> And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.<br>
<a name='022' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/022.html' target='xr'>22.</a> And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, <i>was</i> for song: he instructed about the song, because he <i>was</i> skilful.<br>
<a name='023' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/023.html' target='xr'>23.</a> And Berechiah and Elkanah <i>were</i> doorkeepers for the ark.<br>
<a name='024' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/024.html' target='xr'>24.</a> And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah <i>were</i> doorkeepers for the ark.<br>
<a name='025' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/025.html' target='xr'>25.</a> So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.<br>
<a name='026' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/026.html' target='xr'>26.</a> And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.<br>
<a name='027' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/027.html' target='xr'>27.</a> And David <i>was</i> clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also <i>had</i> upon him an ephod of linen.<br>
<a name='028' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/028.html' target='xr'>28.</a> Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.<br>
<a name='029' href='../../xr/1Chron/015/029.html' target='xr'>29.</a> And it came to pass, <i>as</i> the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.<br>
