<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">There is an evil being, often mentioned in Scripture, both in the Old and New Testaments called Satan, the devil, and Beelzebub, and by other significant names. But he is always spoken of as one: the original Greek for devil ({GK}) never being found in the plural, to signify devils; though the plural is used in the New Testament for slanderers. It is true, the word devils, in the plural, is often read in our version; but the original thus translated, is an entirely different word, and would more properly be rendered demons. From this some have been disposed to</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='65'>65</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">maintain, that these demons were of an entirely different nature from the person called Diabolus and Satan; and some have conjectured that they were the departed spirits of wicked men. But there is little foundation in the Scriptures for these conjectures. Satan is no doubt greatly superior to all the other evil spirits; but whether of a different species we cannot tell. One individual of the same species may be endowed with powers far above the rest. An opinion which has more probability is, that Satan, in a state of innocence, was an archangel, or prince over a large number of the celestial host; and that by his influence, those subject to his authority were seduced from their allegiance, and fell with him in the same transgression. For he is still called "the prince of the devils" [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/Matt/009.html#034' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/009/034.html' target='xr'>9:34</a>; <a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/Matt/012.html#024' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/012/024.html' target='xr'>12:24</a>; <a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/Mark/003.html#022' target='kj'>Mark</a> <a href='../../../xr/Mark/003/022.html' target='xr'>3:22</a>]—"the god of this world," [<a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/2Cor/004.html#004' target='kj'>2 Cor</a> <a href='../../../xr/2Cor/004/004.html' target='xr'>4:4</a>] "the prince of the power of the air," [<a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/Eph/002.html#002' target='kj'>Eph</a> <a href='../../../xr/Eph/002/002.html' target='xr'>2:2</a>] "the spirit that worketh in the children of disobedience," "the adversary that goeth about seeking whom he may devour." [<a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/1Pet/005.html#009' target='kj'>1 Pet</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Pet/005/009.html' target='xr'>5:9</a>] And, what comes nearer to the point, we read of hell being originally prepared for "the devil and his angels." [<a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/Matt/025.html#041' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/025/041.html' target='xr'>25:41</a>] And as we know that evil spirits are very numerous, we may infer, that they are all in subjection to this prince of darkness; whether willingly, or unwillingly, it would be vain to inquire. And this will account for what, to many has appeared difficult to be understood, how Satan can tempt so many persons, all over the world, at once; it would seem, at first view, that he is omnipresent. But if he has at his command thousands of emissaries, or even if this host of evil spirits act independently of him, the difficulty will be removed. It ought, however, to be remembered, that a spirit can pass from place to place more rapidly than the light; and Satan may be carrying on his temptations in America</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">this moment, and the next he may be in Europe, and then in Africa or Asia, and back again, in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The Scriptures make it certain, that our first parents were seduced by the devil, in the form of the serpent; and that the curse denounced on the serpent related chiefly to him. In the book of Revelation, he is called "that old serpent the devil;" [<a name='s10070' href='../../../kj/Rev/012.html#009' target='kj'>Rev</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rev/012/009.html' target='xr'>12:9</a>; <a name='s10080' href='../../../kj/Rev/020.html#002' target='kj'>Rev</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rev/020/002.html' target='xr'>20:2</a>] and by our Lord it is declared, that "he was a murderer from the beginning," [<a name='s10090' href='../../../kj/John/008.html#044' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/008/044.html' target='xr'>8:44</a>] and "a liar and the father of it," which can have no other reference than to the bringing death on our first parents, and their posterity; and to the lie—the first ever told in this world—by which he deceived the woman, when he said, "Thou shalt not surely die." [<a name='s10100' href='../../../kj/Gen/003.html#004' target='kj'>Gen</a> <a href='../../../xr/Gen/003/004.html' target='xr'>3:4</a>] And for these reasons he is called "a murderer," and "the father of lies."</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">How great his malice is against the people of God, and what injuries he would inflict upon them, if permitted, may be learned from the book of Job.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">At the advent of our Saviour, he seems to have been let loose in an unusual manner; for "the Son of God was manifested to destroy the works of the devil," [<a name='s10110' href='../../../kj/1John/003.html#008' target='kj'>1 John</a> <a href='../../../xr/1John/003/008.html' target='xr'>3:8</a>] and therefore the powers of darkness were permitted to exert their malice and cunning, in a degree greater than at any other period. As Christ came to accomplish a salvation which the first Adam had failed to secure, there was a propriety in his being exposed to the temptations of the same adversary who had overcome our first representative. Accordingly Satan made an insidious attack on our Lord, as soon as he came up from the waters of baptism; and he was led into the wilderness by the Spirit for this very purpose. But in this assault, he was completely repulsed; and when our Substitute died on the cross, which Satan had brought about</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='67'>67</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">by entering into Judas, the serpent's head was completely bruised by the Seed of the woman, whilst he could do no more than bruise the heel of the God-man Mediator. In the view of this victory, Christ said, on a certain occasion, "I saw Satan as lightning fall from heaven." [<a name='s10120' href='../../../kj/Luke/010.html#018' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/010/018.html' target='xr'>10:18</a>] And again, "Now is the prince of this world judged." [<a name='s10130' href='../../../kj/John/016.html#011' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/016/011.html' target='xr'>16:11</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Whilst Christ was on earth many persons were possessed of demons, who, entering into them, agitated and convulsed their bodies in a very hideous manner; and so governed the bodies of the miserable sufferers, that they became mere instruments of the evil spirits, who made use of their tongues to utter what the demons wished. The power of our Saviour was manifested, frequently and triumphantly, in ejecting the unclean spirits from the bodies in which they had taken up their abode. Sometimes, many would take possession of one person. In one case, a certain demoniac, upon being asked his name, answered, "<i>Legion</i>, because we are many." [<a name='s10140' href='../../../kj/Mark/005.html#009' target='kj'>Mark</a> <a href='../../../xr/Mark/005/009.html' target='xr'>5:9</a>] And in another case, seven devils were cast out of one woman, who became eminent for her tender love to her Saviour. And our Lord mentions a case where a demon, for a time, left the person possessed, and wandering about in dry places, and finding no rest, said, "I will return to my house, whence I came out; and taking seven other spirits more wicked than himself, he returned and found his house ready for him, swept and garnished, and they went in and dwelt there; and the last state of that man was worse than the first." [<a name='s10150' href='../../../kj/Matt/012.html#045' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/012/045.html' target='xr'>12:45</a>; <a name='s10160' href='../../../kj/Luke/011.html#026' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/011/026.html' target='xr'>11:26</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">We are not to suppose that the mere <a name='g10010' href='../../../rf/gl/d.html#demoniacal' target='gl'>demoniacal</a> possession of a person was a crime; or, that what was said or done by a demoniac, would be charged on the man or woman possessed; but these possessions</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='68'>68</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">were probably the punishment of sins which they had committed; or, as in case of the blind man, "that the works of God might be manifest in them." [<a name='s10170' href='../../../kj/John/009.html#003' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/009/003.html' target='xr'>9:3</a>] Because the effects produced on the human body by these possessions greatly resemble certain diseases, such as insanity and epilepsy, to which the human frame is subject, some learned men have maintained, that what are called <a name='g10020' href='../../../rf/gl/d.html#demoniacal' target='gl'>demoniacal</a> possessions in the New Testament, were nothing but incurable diseases, and allege, that the miracle is as real upon this hypothesis, as on the other. This is true; but the objection to this opinion is, that it undermines the truth of the Gospel history. If nothing more was said than that certain <a name='g10030' href='../../../rf/gl/d.html#demoniacs' target='gl'>demoniacs</a> were healed, this hypothesis might be admitted. For we read, that among others who were healed by our Saviour, were <i>lunatics</i>, and yet, no educated man now believes that madness is produced by the moon. But in regard to <a name='g10040' href='../../../rf/gl/d.html#demoniacal' target='gl'>demoniacal</a> possessions, the evangelists relate conversations which passed between them and our Lord; and, in one instance, where there were many in one man, they entreated that they might not be sent out of the country, but should be permitted to enter into a numerous herd of swine, which were on the mountain, near the lake; and permission being given, the herd of swine ran violently down a precipice into the sea, and were drowned. If all this is to be taken as a mere accommodation to Jewish prejudices, then we can have no certainty of any of the facts related by the evangelists. And, indeed, the censure would fall back on our Saviour himself, who continually speaks of <a name='g10050' href='../../../rf/gl/d.html#demoniacs' target='gl'>demoniacs</a> as persons really possessed by unclean spirits. And as a further proof of the reality of such possessions, it may be remarked, that the demons acknowledged Christ to be the Son of</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='69'>69</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">God; and that in a country where the people knew him not, and begged him to depart from their coasts. It is expressly said, that upon the approach of Jesus, the demon cried out, "What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God, the most high? I adjure thee, by God, that thou torment me not." [<a name='s10180' href='../../../kj/Mark/005.html#007' target='kj'>Mark</a> <a href='../../../xr/Mark/005/007.html' target='xr'>5:7</a>; <a name='s10190' href='../../../kj/Luke/008.html#028' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/008/028.html' target='xr'>8:28</a>] And he asked him, "What is thy name?" and he answered, saying, "My name is legion, for we are many. And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. Now there was nigh the mountains a great herd of swine feeding, and all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. And forthwith Jesus gave them leave, and the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine, and the herd ran violently down a steep place, and perished in the sea." [<a name='s10200' href='../../../kj/Mark/005.html#009' target='kj'>Mark</a> <a href='../../../xr/Mark/005/009.html' target='xr'>5:9</a>-13] Now, if any one, upon a careful perusal of this narrative, can persuade himself that these were no real spirits, but that it was simply a case of insanity, and that demons are introduced in accommodation to the common prejudices of the Jews, he will have adopted a principle of interpretation which will go far towards subverting the whole gospel history. For, why may it not be as reasonably supposed, that when Christ speaks of the resurrection of the body, or of a future judgment, he is merely uttering opinions common among the <a name='g10060' href='../../../rf/gl/p.html#pharisees' target='gl'>Pharisees</a>, the predominant sect of the Jews? In answer to the allegation, that the symptoms were precisely the same, as of diseases which are still often met with, it may be replied that the demons might be permitted to produce these very diseases, as we know that these malignant spirits are capable of producing diseases of any kind, if permitted without restraint to operate with the power which naturally belongs to them,</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='70'>70</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">as we see in the case of Job, and of the woman healed by our Saviour, on the Sabbath day, "whom," said he, "Satan hath bound, lo! these eighteen years." [<a name='s10210' href='../../../kj/Luke/013.html#016' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/013/016.html' target='xr'>13:16</a>] And, in some of these diseases, as they now occur, we know too little about their real causes to make it the ground for argument. Physicians are very little acquainted with the causes of diseases of every species. All they can ascertain by the most accurate examination is, the disease itself, or the derangement of some part of the human system. But in many cases, they can acquire no knowledge of the cause of that disorder; and for any thing we know, evil spirits may now, sometimes, have a power over the bodies of men, by permission. We do not assert this as a fact, but only that the thing is not impossible, nor altogether improbable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">But our principal concern with the existence of evil spirits, does not relate to their power to injure the body, but their cunning and malice in tempting men to sin. As Satan tempted our Lord, so he did his disciples. He took complete possession of Judas, by his consent, and induced him to commit the most enormous crime on record. He also tempted Peter, and for a season overcame him, and had he not been preserved from utter apostasy, by the intercession of his Lord, we have reason to think that his case would have been as desperate as that of Judas. Christ says, "Simon, Simon, Satan hath desired to have you, to sift you as wheat, but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not." [<a name='s10220' href='../../../kj/Luke/022.html#031' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/022/031.html' target='xr'>22:31</a>-32] And when Ananias and Sapphira were guilty of an enormous crime, in lying to the Holy Ghost, Peter, in his address, said, "Why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie unto the Holy Ghost?" [<a name='s10230' href='../../../kj/Acts/005.html#003' target='kj'>Acts</a> <a href='../../../xr/Acts/005/003.html' target='xr'>5:3</a>] And that true believers have to endure a severe conflict with these powers of darkness</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='71'>71</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">is exceedingly evident from what Paul says, in his Epistle to the Ephesians. "Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil; for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." [<a name='s10240' href='../../../kj/Eph/006.html#012' target='kj'>Eph</a> <a href='../../../xr/Eph/006/012.html' target='xr'>6:12</a>] He exhorts, "to take the shield of faith to quench the fiery darts of the wicked." [<a name='s10250' href='../../../kj/Eph/006.html#016' target='kj'>Eph</a> <a href='../../../xr/Eph/006/016.html' target='xr'>6:16</a>] It is hence manifest, that Christians are surrounded by a host of spiritual enemies, of whom the devil is the leader; and it would seem that there are the same orders among the fallen, as among the blessed angels. They are described as "principalities, powers, and rulers, and as spiritual wickedness in high places." And in <a name='s10260' href='../../../kj/2Cor/002.html#011' target='kj'>2 Cor</a> <a href='../../../xr/2Cor/002/011.html' target='xr'>2:11</a>, Paul cautions those to whom he wrote, "Lest Satan should get an advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices." And Peter recognizes the existence and malice of the same invisible enemy, in his exhortation to Christians. "Be sober, be vigilant, for your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour." [<a name='s10270' href='../../../kj/1Pet/005.html#008' target='kj'>1 Pet</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Pet/005/008.html' target='xr'>5:8</a>] And Paul exhorts the Ephesians, "Neither give place to the devil," [<a name='s10280' href='../../../kj/Eph/004.html#027' target='kj'>Eph</a> <a href='../../../xr/Eph/004/027.html' target='xr'>4:27</a>] that is, do not yield to him; resist him. The same exhortation, in substance, is given by James. "Resist the devil and he will flee from you." [<a name='s10290' href='../../../kj/James/004.html#007' target='kj'>James</a> <a href='../../../xr/James/004/007.html' target='xr'>4:7</a>] This doctrine of spiritual enemies watching our path and seeking our destruction, is, at first view, very appalling; until we recollect, that the Captain of our salvation is able to bruise Satan under our feet; yea, has already conquered him, and has him completely under his control, and has promised to his people "that they shall not be tempted above what they are able to bear," [<a name='s10300' href='../../../kj/1Cor/010.html#013' target='kj'>1 Cor</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Cor/010/013.html' target='xr'>10:13</a>] and that "with the temptation he will make a way for their escape."</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='72'>72</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">But if the real Christian is thus exposed to the temptations of the evil one, what must be the condition of impenitent men? The Scriptures are also very explicit and full on this point. They are said to be "led captive by the devil at his will." [<a name='s10310' href='../../../kj/2Tim/002.html#026' target='kj'>2 Tim</a> <a href='../../../xr/2Tim/002/026.html' target='xr'>2:26</a>] Those who are "dead in trespasses and sins," [<a name='s10320' href='../../../kj/Eph/002.html#001' target='kj'>Eph</a> <a href='../../../xr/Eph/002/001.html' target='xr'>2:1</a>] are described as "walking according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience." [<a name='s10330' href='../../../kj/Eph/002.html#002' target='kj'>Eph</a> <a href='../../../xr/Eph/002/002.html' target='xr'>2:2</a>] When the gospel is preached, Satan taketh away the word that was sown in the hearts of the hearers. He is also said to "blind the minds of those who believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ should shine unto them." [<a name='s10340' href='../../../kj/2Cor/004.html#004' target='kj'>2 Cor</a> <a href='../../../xr/2Cor/004/004.html' target='xr'>4:4</a>] And when men are converted, they are translated from the power of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son. "He that committeth sin is of the devil, for the devil sinneth from the beginning." [<a name='s10350' href='../../../kj/1John/003.html#008' target='kj'>1 John</a> <a href='../../../xr/1John/003/008.html' target='xr'>3:8</a>] "Ye are of your father the devil, and the works of your father ye will do." [<a name='s10360' href='../../../kj/John/008.html#044' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/008/044.html' target='xr'>8:44</a>] "When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace." [<a name='s10370' href='../../../kj/Luke/011.html#021' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/011/021.html' target='xr'>11:21</a>] Wretched, indeed, is the condition of those who are under the power of such a malignant spirit. They are willing slaves to the most cruel of masters.</p>
