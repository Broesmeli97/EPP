<p align="center" style="text-align:center" class="msonormal"><span style="letter-spacing:1.0pt">LAW OF GOD</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">From the relation which a rational creature sustains to his Creator, arises an obligation to perfect obedience. The right of the Author of our being to what he has made out of nothing, is the <a name='g10010' href='../../../rf/gl/c.html#completest' target='gl'>completest</a> right of which we can form a conception. And, as God is infinitely excellent and glorious in his own nature, it is reasonable that he should require the supreme love of the rational creature. If we had any thing better than our love and gratitude to give, in return for what we have received from our Creator and Preserver, we should be under obligation to render the best which we possibly could; but since pure love is the best offering of which we are capable, God requires that. But when perfect obedience is rendered, we do not repay our debt; this never can be done. When we have done all, we have only performed our duty, and as it relates to God, are "unprofitable servants." [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/Luke/017.html#010' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/017/010.html' target='xr'>17:10</a>] When man was created, he was endowed with the necessary knowledge of God, and his disposition was conformable to his law, which was written on his heart. But when man sinned, the image of God, as far as it consisted in moral likeness, was lost; but some knowledge of duty, and feeling of moral obligation remained. This, however, through ignorance and negligence, was soon so obscured, that except in regard to a few great enormities, men have generally lost sight of</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='82'>82</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">the law of God as a rule of duty, reaching not only to the outward actions, but to the thoughts and affections of the heart. It became very necessary, therefore, that there should be a new revelation of the moral law, and such a specification of particular duties, as was suited to the people of Israel, to whom the revelation was made. This revelation was communicated by God himself from mount Horeb, in the midst of thunderings and <a href='../../../rf/gl/l.html#lightnings' target='gl'>lightnings</a> and darkness and tempest, in a voice of tremendous majesty: and the <a name='g10030' href='../../../rf/gl/d.html#decalogue' target='gl'>Decalogue</a> which contained the specifications of this moral law, was written by the finger of God on two tables of stone, after having been uttered in a voice of thunder from the midst of the fiery mountain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The sum and substance of the moral law, as it relates to the inner man, is comprehended in two commandments, which are recognized by our Saviour as still in force, and as containing summarily all moral duty. The first of these is, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord, and thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy <a href='../../../rf/gl/n.html#neighbour' target='gl'>neighbour</a> as thyself. On these two hang all the law and the prophets." [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/Mark/012.html#029' target='kj'>Mark</a> <a href='../../../xr/Mark/012/029.html' target='xr'>12:29</a>; <a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/Matt/022.html#037' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/022/037.html' target='xr'>22:37</a>-40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">As to the dispositions and affections of heart, required by this law, they are the same to all persons, and under all dispensations; but as to the external acts required, they vary according to the relations in which men are placed. While, therefore, the principles of moral obedience are simple, the acts which may be incumbent on moral agents, may be infinitely diversified. All, however, in every situation, are bound externally to reverence and worship God, and to exercise justice and mercy in their intercourse with their fellow men. And there are also moral duties which have respect to</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='83'>83</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">ourselves. It is the duty of all, by lawful means, to seek their own welfare—the improvement of their minds, and the health and purity of their bodies; and to avoid every thing which has any tendency to injure themselves. The exhortation, "Do thyself no harm," [<a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/Acts/016.html#028' target='kj'>Acts</a> <a href='../../../xr/Acts/016/028.html' target='xr'>16:28</a>] is of general application, and is a moral duty of great importance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">It has been common to divide moral duties into three classes; such as we owe to God, to our <a href='../../../rf/gl/n.html#neighbour' target='gl'>neighbour</a>, and to ourselves. From what has been said, it is evident, that there is some foundation, in the nature of the case, for this threefold distinction. But it seems scarcely correct to speak of owing duties to our fellow creatures, or to ourselves, as though we had more sovereigns than one. There is, strictly, but one Sovereign and one Judge, to whom we owe allegiance. We are bound to love our <a href='../../../rf/gl/n.html#neighbour' target='gl'>neighbour</a>, because God enjoins it; and to promote our own welfare, for the same reason. We are under one moral law which is binding, because it is made known to us to be the will of God. It is obvious, that when all internal holiness is comprehended in love, this word must be taken in a generic sense, to include all right affections toward God, and toward our fellow creatures, such as reverence, trust, gratitude, etc.; and a like latitude should be given to it, in relation to our fellow men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The law of God is perfect. It has been justly called a transcript of the moral <a name='g10070' href='../../../rf/gl/p.html#perfections' target='gl'>perfections</a> of God. It is the highest standard of moral dignity and excellence, of which the creature is capable. It is also the measure of man's supreme happiness. We see then, not only that it is just in God to require perfect obedience to the law, and that to require less would be a derogation from his holiness; but that his goodness is equally manifest in the requisition of all the love and obedience</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='84'>84</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">of which the nature of man is susceptible; for it is that very state of mind, in which man's purest and <a name='g10080' href='../../../rf/gl/s.html#sublimest' target='gl'>sublimest</a> happiness consists. And if we should, for a moment, suppose, that a less degree of love and obedience should be required, either as to intensity or constancy, where would we fix this degree? It is evident, that in proportion as man falls short of perfect love, or that degree of love to his Creator, of which he is constitutionally capable, so far he sinks in moral dignity and excellence. And no man can fix any other measure of love, which might not be, on the same principle, lowered more and more, until nothing was left.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">But the law of God is also just, for it requires no more than what the creature, as he came from the hands of his Creator, had full power to render. In the case of all creatures, in innocence, the maxim is correct, that duty and ability must be commensurate. Accordingly, God does not require man to love or obey, with the powers of an angel, but to love the Lord his God with all his heart, mind, and strength. But this maxim cannot with propriety be applied to the case of those who by their own fault have lost the ability of rendering perfect obedience. The law of God cannot lower its demands in proportion to the inability of man, brought on by transgression. That blindness of mind, and that hardness of heart, and perversity of will, produced by sinning, are in themselves sinful, and cannot, therefore, furnish any excuse. In fact, these things constitute the root and core of our depravity, and are the very things for which man shall chiefly be condemned. The same is true of inveterate habits of sin, and errors which are the fruit of sin. These things cannot excuse, or there would be no blame any where. No moral change, however, affects the essence of the soul; its faculties remain the same</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='85'>85</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">under all moral conditions. Sin destroys no constitutional faculty, and regeneration produces no new faculty. Man, in all stages of his existence, continues to be a free moral agent. If this were not the case, he could not be the subject of a moral government. Whatever the law requires, therefore, man has the mental faculties which are sufficient for its performance, if they were under the direction and government of right dispositions of heart. These things being rightly understood, the difficulty and perplexity often experienced in regard to man's being required to perform what he has no power to perform, will be removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Besides those duties which arise out of our natural relations, and which are called moral, God may prescribe other actions, commanding the creature to perform acts, or abstain from acts, which in themselves are indifferent, that is, destitute of a moral character; and these acts when commanded or forbidden, are as really binding on the conscience as those dictated by reason, for, whatever is known to be the will of God, is law, and obligatory. The only difference between duties of this class, and others, is, that the obligation rests simply on the revealed will of God; and having nothing of a holy or sinful nature considered in themselves, they may be changed or abolished at the pleasure of the Sovereign. But moral duties are, in the same relations, and under the same circumstances, immutable; they cannot be dispensed with. This lays a foundation for the distinction between moral and positive precepts. The first God must require, or cease to be holy; the last are binding when commanded, but may be changed or abolished by the Lawgiver, according to his wisdom and pleasure. It is not to be understood, however, that ceremonial, or positive precepts have nothing of a moral nature. The difference</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='86'>86</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">between moral and positive duties is merely in the external act; but as to the motive and end, there is no difference whatever. God's commands must be obeyed from love to him, and with a view to his glory, of whatever kind they be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The <a name='g10090' href='../../../rf/gl/d.html#decalogue' target='gl'>decalogue</a>, or Ten Commandments, should be considered as a general specification of the duties arising out of the usual relations in which men stand; and not intended to express every particular species of duty, or every conceivable kind of sin. Such a law, thus carried out in minute detail, would be useless by its bulk, and by the multiplicity of particulars would distract, rather than direct. The method chosen, is by far more consonant with wisdom, where the principles of moral duty are clearly laid down, and such a number of specifications given, as will enable the conscientious reader or hearer to form a correct judgment respecting similar cases.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The following rules have been given as useful in the explanation of the <a name='g10100' href='../../../rf/gl/d.html#decalogue' target='gl'>Decalogue</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">1. The law is spiritual, and extends not only to the external acts of the body, but to the thoughts, desires, and purposes of the heart or mind. Paul, in <a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/Rom/007.html#014' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/007/014.html' target='xr'>7:14</a>, testifies that the law is spiritual. "For we know that the law is spiritual." <a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/Rom/007.html#007' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/007/007.html' target='xr'>7:7</a>. "For I had not known sin, unless the law had said, Thou shalt not covet." The same thing may be conclusively argued from the character of the Lawgiver, who is holy, and whose prerogative it is, to search the heart. And in the common judgment of mankind, the good or evil of an act must be traced to the motive and the purpose of the agent. Civil rulers can only take cognizance of overt acts, but God judgeth the heart. Hence it often happens, that that which is highly esteemed among men, is an abomination in the sight of God;</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='87'>87</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">because man looketh on the outward appearance, but God looketh on the heart. And this is strongly confirmed and illustrated in our Saviour's exposition of the true nature of the law, where he represents malice to possess the guilt of murder, and a wanton eye that of adultery.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">2. In affirmative precepts, negative must be considered as included; and <i>vice versa</i>, negative in affirmative.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">In many passages of Scripture much more is meant, than is explicitly expressed. But in the application of this rule, caution and sound judgment are requisite, lest we make the law a mere Lesbian rule, a nose of wax, which can be bent into any shape—a vague and indefinite thing, which every one may understand in that sense which suits him. We must inquire accurately and profoundly, into the mind of the Legislator as elsewhere expressed, and pay strict attention to the context, and to the occasion on which any precept was spoken.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">It is plain, however, that a precept enjoining something good, cannot be obeyed without avoiding the contrary evil. It is also evident, that when any particular sin is forbidden, obedience cannot be rendered, without cultivating and <a href='../../../rf/gl/p.html#practising' target='gl'>practising</a> the contrary virtue. Thus, when it is said, "Thou shalt not kill," [<a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/Exod/020.html#013' target='kj'>Exod</a> <a href='../../../xr/Exod/020/013.html' target='xr'>20:13</a>; <a name='s10070' href='../../../kj/Deut/005.html#017' target='kj'>Deut</a> <a href='../../../xr/Deut/005/017.html' target='xr'>5:17</a>; <a name='s10080' href='../../../kj/Matt/005.html#021' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/005/021.html' target='xr'>5:21</a>; <a name='s10090' href='../../../kj/Rom/013.html#009' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/013/009.html' target='xr'>13:9</a>] it is evident that it is implied, that we should not only refrain from injuring our <a href='../../../rf/gl/n.html#neighbour' target='gl'>neighbour</a>, but should do what we can to promote his welfare. And the command, not to steal, includes an obligation to advance, as far as it may be in our power, our <a href='../../../rf/gl/n.html#neighbour' target='gl'>neighbour</a>'s property and outward estate. And every one sees, that the command to honour our parents, includes a prohibition to dishonour or injure them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">3. In each of the commandments it is necessary to</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='88'>88</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">suppose, that, for brevity's sake, a part is put for the whole; a specimen which may be said to represent all duties or sins of the same class: and the prohibition of any sin, includes all things which would tend toward it, and all inclinations leading to its commission. Thus, when it is said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery," [<a name='s10100' href='../../../kj/Exod/020.html#014' target='kj'>Exod</a> <a href='../../../xr/Exod/020/014.html' target='xr'>20:14</a>; <a name='s10110' href='../../../kj/Matt/005.html#027' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/005/027.html' target='xr'>5:27</a>; <a name='s10120' href='../../../kj/Matt/019.html#018' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/019/018.html' target='xr'>19:18</a>; <a name='s10130' href='../../../kj/Rom/013.html#009' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/013/009.html' target='xr'>13:9</a>] all impure conduct is forbidden, as sodomy, incest, fornication, and all lascivious actions; also all unchaste thoughts, imaginations and desires which lead to the commission of the crimes that belong to this class.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">4. The cause must be considered as included in the effect, the genus in the species, and the correlative in the relative. Thus, in the prohibition of stealing, covetousness, its cause, is forbidden. In the prohibition of murder, cherished anger is included. Under the head of theft, every species of fraud and injustice is included. Under the sin of "taking the name of the Lord in vain" [<a name='s10140' href='../../../kj/Exod/020.html#007' target='kj'>Exod</a> <a href='../../../xr/Exod/020/007.html' target='xr'>20:7</a>; <a name='s10150' href='../../../kj/Deut/005.html#011' target='kj'>Deut</a> <a href='../../../xr/Deut/005/011.html' target='xr'>5:11</a>; <a name='s10160' href='../../../kj/Ps/139.html#020' target='kj'>Ps</a> <a href='../../../xr/Ps/139/020.html' target='xr'>139:20</a>] is included all <a name='g10140' href='../../../rf/gl/p.html#profaneness' target='gl'>profaneness</a>, and want of due reverence for any thing relating to God, as all trifling and jesting with his word; and all ridicule or contempt of the worship and ordinances of his house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">So also, when the duty of children to parents is enjoined, the correlative duties of parents to their children must be considered as required. And the mention of one class of relative duties, must be considered as a specimen of all relative duties. It is right, therefore, under the fifth commandment, to comprehend the duties of magistrates and subjects, of masters and servants, of pastors and their flocks, of husbands and wives, and of every relation which lawfully exists among men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">There are two rules laid down by theologians on this subject, which though generally true, cannot be considered as universally applicable.</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='89'>89</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">5. The one is, that the duties of the first table, or those which have God for their object, should have preference above those of the second table, which have our fellow men for their object. But, if a man be in danger of perishing, and we can save his life, by omitting prayer, or the worship of God, it is obviously our duty to give preference to the duty of saving the life of a fellow creature. Many other cases might be supposed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">6. The second rule, commonly laid down, and which is not of universal application, is, that moral duties take the preference over positive; mercy must be preferred to sacrifice. For this we have the authority of the prophets and our Saviour himself: "I will have mercy and not sacrifice." [<a name='s10170' href='../../../kj/Matt/009.html#013' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/009/013.html' target='xr'>9:13</a>; <a name='s10180' href='../../../kj/Matt/012.html#007' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/012/007.html' target='xr'>12:7</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Neither must this rule be considered as universally applicable. Indeed, we cannot in any case, determine our duty by it, without regard to the nature and circumstances of the duties which may come into competition; for where there is no inconsistency in performing the duties, both kinds are obligatory, though some may be much more important than others. The <a name='g10150' href='../../../rf/gl/p.html#pharisees' target='gl'>Pharisees</a> who neglected the weightier matters of the law, and were scrupulous in observing the payment of tithes, even on the herbs of the garden, are not blamed for tithing mint, anise, and <a name='g10160' href='../../../rf/gl/c.html#cummin' target='gl'>cummin</a>, but for neglecting much more important duties; as appears by the words of our Saviour, "These ought ye to have done, and not leave the others undone." [<a name='s10190' href='../../../kj/Matt/023.html#023' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/023/023.html' target='xr'>23:23</a>; <a name='s10200' href='../../../kj/Luke/011.html#042' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/011/042.html' target='xr'>11:42</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">But when moral and positive duties interfere, the question is, whether the moral must in all cases have the precedence. That mercy should be preferred to sacrifice, is clearly revealed, but that in every case, a divinely appointed ordinance must give way to every species of moral duty, cannot properly be inferred from</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='90'>90</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">this text. Suppose a believer to be so situated that he has the opportunity of receiving Christian baptism, or attending on the Lord's supper, and to be under the necessity of going on a tedious voyage to sea, would it be his duty to neglect either of these holy sacraments, for the sake of performing some moral act not of the first importance, which could not be performed, unless he would omit these positive duties? For example, suppose that just when about to attend on the Lord's supper, he should be sent for, to visit a sick person at a distance, would he be bound to neglect the only opportunity he might ever have, to receive either of the sacraments of the Christian church? I think not. Indeed, to Christians, as commonly situated, it would not be proper to absent themselves from the table of the Lord, in order to pull an ox or sheep out of a pit, into which it had fallen; though this is a moral duty, when not called to the performance of other duties, which are more important.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Why the ceremonies of religion are sometimes spoken of in a disparaging way, was on account of the total defect of spirituality. As Isaiah says, "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord, I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts, and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of rams, or of he-goats. When you come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hands to tread my courts?" [<a name='s10210' href='../../../kj/Isa/001.html#011' target='kj'>Isa</a> <a href='../../../xr/Isa/001/011.html' target='xr'>1:11</a>-12] And again, "He that killeth an ox, is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, is as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol."

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">not acceptable, but because the people utterly neglected the moral and spiritual part of worship, which is its essence, and depended entirely on the performance of external rites, while they indulged without restraint their wicked inclinations; vainly trusting that these observances would be a compensation for all moral defects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">7. Another rule which has been given for the interpretation of the moral law is, "That affirmative precepts are always obligatory, but do not require a constant performance; whereas negative precepts are not only always obligatory, but must be constantly observed." This rule, though true, is of very little use, as the direction contained in it, is obvious to the reason of every reflecting man. The duty of prayer is always obligatory, but not a duty to be performed at all times; but the negative precept, forbidding us to take the name of the Lord in vain, binds us always, and is always to be observed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The moral law will be better understood by considering the nature of the obedience which it demands; and this may be comprehended in the following particulars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">I. The law reaches to the whole of man; to the soul with all its faculties, and to the body with all its members.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">II. A fourfold perfection is required by the law.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">1. It must be cordial or from the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">2. Universal, both as to its object and its parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">3. In the degree of its intensity—with all the heart, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">4. In its duration; it must never cease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">8. The beginning, middle and end of obedience, is love out of a pure heart, and faith unfeigned. But under the term love is comprehended as was said before,</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">every virtuous feeling and holy purpose and emotion. When the word is thus taken, "love is the fulfilling of the law."

As on these hang all the law and the prophets, that is, all incumbent duties, in them must be included all holy affections toward God, and all right dispositions toward our fellow creatures, according to our relation to them and our opportunity of doing them good, "for love worketh no ill to his <a href='../../../rf/gl/n.html#neighbour' target='gl'>neighbour</a>."</p>
