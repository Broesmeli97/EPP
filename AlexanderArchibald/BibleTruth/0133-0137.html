<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">In regeneration, spiritual life is communicated; but this incipient principle is in its infancy, when first implanted. The <a href='../../../rf/gl/v.html#vigour' target='gl'>vigour</a> of spiritual life seems to be analogous to natural life, very different in different subjects. But in all it is imperfect, and needs to be assiduously cherished and nurtured, that it may daily gain strength, and gradually rise to maturity. There are various means of divine appointment conducive to this end, in the use of which growth is as certain as in the body when supplied with nutriment. In the former as well as in the latter, there may be seasons of decay, arising from various untoward causes; but, it may be assumed as a fact, that where the principle of piety is really <a name='g10020' href='../../../rf/gl/r.html#radicated' target='gl'>radicated</a> in the soul, there will be growth; the steady tendency will be to a state of maturity. And, although perfection is never attained in this life, yet there is in all true Christians a sincere desire after it, and there may be a constant approximation toward it, as long as they live. And such a state of piety may be attained, as, comparatively, may be termed a state of perfection, and is so termed in Scripture. From what has been said, it will be apparent, that sanctification does not differ specifically from regeneration; the one is the commencement, the other the continuance and increase of the same principle.</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='134'>134</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Two things are commonly intended by the word sanctification. The first is, the mortification of sin; the last, the increase of the <a href='../../../rf/gl/v.html#vigour' target='gl'>vigour</a> and constancy of the exercises of piety. But, although these may be distinguished, yet there is no need to treat of them separately, because the advancement of the one cannot but be accompanied with progress in the other. Like the two scales of a balance, when one is depressed the other rises. Just so in the divine life in the soul, if pride is humbled, humility is of necessity increased; if the undue love of the creature is mortified, the love of God will be strengthened; and so of every other grace. Indeed, when we examine the subject accurately, we shall find, that all real mortification of sin is by the exercise of faith, and those holy affections which flow from it. By legal striving, however earnest, or by ascetic discipline, however rigid, very little headway is made against the stream of inherent corruption. It is right, indeed, to keep the body under, lest its blind appetites and impulses should hinder the exercises of religion; and occasional fasting, when free from superstition, does greatly aid the spiritual progress of the true Christian; and this is especially the fact, when he is in conflict with some fleshly lust, or easily besetting sin. A pampered body will ever be an enemy to growth in grace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">It must not be forgotten, that we are as dependent on the Holy Spirit for every holy act and exercise, as for the ability to put forth the first act of faith, when regenerated. We have no strength in ourselves, in consequence of our justification and conversion. Christ has said, "Without me ye can do nothing." [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/John/015.html#005' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/015/005.html' target='xr'>15:5</a>] He is the vine, and believers are the branches. "As the branch cannot bear fruit except it abide in the vine,</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='135'>135</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">neither can ye except ye abide in me." [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/John/015.html#004' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/015/004.html' target='xr'>15:4</a>] Yet this does not take away or diminish our motives for exertion; so far from it, that it affords the only encouragement which we have for diligence in the use of means. For though the power is of God, that power is exerted through the means of divine appointment. Therefore, in Scripture, divine aid and human agency are constantly united. When Christians are exhorted "to work out their salvation," [<a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/Phil/002.html#012' target='kj'>Phil</a> <a href='../../../xr/Phil/002/012.html' target='xr'>2:12</a>] the reason assigned is, "for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of his own good pleasure." [<a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/Phil/002.html#013' target='kj'>Phil</a> <a href='../../../xr/Phil/002/013.html' target='xr'>2:13</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Where two opposite principles exist in the same person, there must be a conflict. When the whole current of the affections runs toward the world, there being no opposing principle, no conflict is experienced, except that which arises from the <a name='g10040' href='../../../rf/gl/r.html#remonstrances' target='gl'>remonstrances</a> of conscience; or from the discordant craving of conflicting desires of a sinful kind. But, in the true believer, "the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; so that he cannot do the things that he would." [<a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/Gal/005.html#017' target='kj'>Gal</a> <a href='../../../xr/Gal/005/017.html' target='xr'>5:17</a>] And often the spiritual man is made to groan in agony, and to cry out, "O, wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" [<a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/Rom/007.html#024' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/007/024.html' target='xr'>7:24</a>] Although, in this warfare, the principle of grace is generally victorious, for it is written, "sin shall not have dominion over you;" [<a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/Rom/006.html#014' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/006/014.html' target='xr'>6:14</a>] yet, sometimes, by the power of temptation, and negligence in watchfulness, the man of God is cast down and degraded, and unless raised up by the hand of the Captain of his salvation, he would rise no more. But, as the work of grace was begun without any merit or cooperation of the believer, the same love which at first <a name='g10050' href='../../../rf/gl/e.html#effectually' target='gl'>effectually</a> called him away from his sins and from the world, still pursues him, and will not suffer the enemy ultimately to triumph</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='136'>136</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">over him. Satan shall never have the opportunity of boasting that he has accomplished the ruin of one whom God purposed to save, and to save whom Christ died, and who has been <a name='g10060' href='../../../rf/gl/e.html#effectually' target='gl'>effectually</a> called by the Holy Spirit. He may fall, but he shall rise again, for God hath said, "My grace is sufficient for thee," [<a name='s10070' href='../../../kj/2Cor/012.html#009' target='kj'>2 Cor</a> <a href='../../../xr/2Cor/012/009.html' target='xr'>12:9</a>] and, "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee." [<a name='s10080' href='../../../kj/Heb/013.html#005' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/013/005.html' target='xr'>13:5</a>] And not <a name='g10070' href='../../../rf/gl/u.html#unfrequently' target='gl'>unfrequently</a>, the very falls of the children of God are overruled for their more rapid progress in future. Nothing more tends to humble the soul, and destroy self-confidence, than being overtaken by such faults.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The means of sanctification may be comprehended under two general heads, the word of God and prayer. The first is the food which is provided for the nourishment of the soul, and by which it lives. Christ himself is indeed the bread of life—the manna that came down from heaven; but it is only in the word, that we can find Christ: there he is revealed—there his dignity and glory are manifested—there we behold his holy life, his miracles, his sufferings, his death, his resurrection, ascension, and intercession. The whole object of faith, and love, and hope, is found in the word of God. Therefore, it is by the assiduous study of the word, and meditation on its truths, that we are to expect an increase of faith, and a real growth in grace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The other principal means of growth is prayer; especially, prayer for the influences of the Holy Spirit. Without the Spirit, as we have seen, there can be no progress; but this sum of blessings is graciously promised in answer to prayer. And these two means are harmonious; for the word is the "sword of the Spirit." [<a name='s10090' href='../../../kj/Eph/006.html#017' target='kj'>Eph</a> <a href='../../../xr/Eph/006/017.html' target='xr'>6:17</a>] The Spirit operates only by the word. Therefore, though we read that sanctification</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='137'>137</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">is of the Spirit, we also read that effectual prayer of Jesus Christ, "Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth." [<a name='s10100' href='../../../kj/John/017.html#017' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/017/017.html' target='xr'>17:17</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Although all the means of sanctification may be comprehended under the word of God and prayer, yet there are many subordinate means, which have a powerful efficacy in giving application and force to these. In this light may be considered the ministry, the reading of good books, attendance on the sacraments, and fasting. There is one means of grace of this class which we are not required to resort to, but which is often employed by our heavenly Father with great effect, in promoting the sanctification of his children; I mean the chastisements of his rod. The benefit of affliction is often celebrated in Scripture; and almost every child of God can, after a few years' experience, adopt the language of the royal Psalmist, and say, "It was good for me that I was afflicted." [<a name='s10110' href='../../../kj/Ps/119.html#071' target='kj'>Ps</a> <a href='../../../xr/Ps/119/071.html' target='xr'>119:71</a>] And Paul testifies, that though "no chastisement for the present is joyous but grievous, yet afterwards it worketh the peaceable fruits of righteousness in them who are exercised thereby." [<a name='s10120' href='../../../kj/Heb/012.html#011' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/012/011.html' target='xr'>12:11</a>] Afflictions are often used as the means of recovering the children of God from a state of backsliding; as says David, "Before I was afflicted, I went astray, but now I keep thy testimonies." [<a name='s10130' href='../../../kj/Ps/119.html#067' target='kj'>Ps</a> <a href='../../../xr/Ps/119/067.html' target='xr'>119:67</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Though Christians do not arrive at sinless perfection in this life, yet it is a state to which every humble child of God shall attain at death. Christ will present his whole body before his Father's throne, "without spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing." [<a name='s10140' href='../../../kj/Eph/005.html#027' target='kj'>Eph</a> <a href='../../../xr/Eph/005/027.html' target='xr'>5:27</a>] "We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is." [<a name='s10150' href='../../../kj/1John/003.html#002' target='kj'>1 John</a> <a href='../../../xr/1John/003/002.html' target='xr'>3:2</a>]</p>
