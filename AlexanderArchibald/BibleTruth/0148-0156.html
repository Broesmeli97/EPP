<p align="center" style="text-align:center" class="msonormal"><span style="letter-spacing:1.0pt">ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">We read in the Epistle to the Hebrews, both of the "assurance of faith," [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/Heb/010.html#022' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/010/022.html' target='xr'>10:22</a>] and the "assurance of hope." [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/Heb/006.html#011' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/006/011.html' target='xr'>6:11</a>] As faith is itself a belief of the truth, the assurance of faith can signify nothing else than a strong faith, an undoubting conviction of the truth. And, as hope is an expectation of future good, which may be more or</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='149'>149</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">less strong, as the evidence that the good hoped for shall be ours, the assurance of hope is a full persuasion that in due time we shall realize the blessing which we desire. According to this interpretation, the assurance of hope does not differ from the assurance of salvation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The relation between the assurance of faith and the assurance of hope, is hence manifest. The former is the necessary foundation of the latter. Unless we are fully persuaded that there is a full and suitable salvation in Christ, it is impossible that we should be assured that we shall obtain salvation through Him. But as God promises eternal life to every one who believes in Christ, when we do sincerely believe, and when our faith is strong, it is easy to draw the inference, that the salvation of the gospel is ours. The thing stands thus. God says, "he that believeth shall be saved." [<a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/Mark/016.html#016' target='kj'>Mark</a> <a href='../../../xr/Mark/016/016.html' target='xr'>16:16</a>] I am conscious that I believe, therefore, I know that I shall be saved. The strength of this conclusion, or the assurance that I shall obtain salvation, depends first on the assurance which I have that there is salvation in Christ for every one that believes. If I receive this declaration with some degree of dubiety, then there being no assurance of faith, of course, there can be no assurance of salvation. But if this truth be received, without any wavering, then there is a solid foundation on which the assurance of hope may rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">In the next place, having believed in the promise of God, I must know certainly that I have believed, and that my faith is genuine. For although I believe ever so certainly in the truth of God's promise of eternal life to him that believeth, yet, if I doubt whether I have believed, or am uncertain whether my faith is of that kind to which the promise is made,</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='150'>150</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">I cannot possess assurance of salvation. And there seems to be some ground for a doubt of this kind, as we read of several kinds of faith which were not connected with salvation. And one species of faith which was not saving, is represented as being accompanied with joy and every appearance of being genuine, until being put to the trial, it was found to be deficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Again, it ought to be remarked here, that many persons have entertained a strong persuasion that they were the heirs of salvation, and yet their confidence was founded in error or delusion. Therefore, although at first view, it would seem the easiest thing in the world, for a true believer to arrive at assurance of salvation, yet, when we take into view the deceitfulness of the heart, and the power of Satan to transform himself into an angel of light, and also the numerous cases of actual deception which have occurred, we are so far from thinking it easy to arrive at assurance, that we are disposed to believe that an infallible, unwavering assurance, on solid scriptural grounds, can be acquired by no one, without the special witness of the Holy Spirit. Most Christians, at least in our day, do not possess an assurance of salvation which excludes all doubt and fear, as to their future destiny. They have attained to a comfortable hope, but not to the assurance of hope; except at some favoured moments, when the love of God is shed abroad in their heart, by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven. Then the Spirit witnesses with their spirits, that they are the children of God.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">How this witness is given, is a matter concerning which there are different opinions. But as there are spurious joys which may be very ecstatic, it is safest to believe, that this assurance is commonly given, by</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='151'>151</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">bringing into lively exercise, faith, love, and joy; so that there can be no doubt of the existence of these exercises, as there can be none, that they are feelings peculiar to the children of God. The Spirit not only enlightens the mind to discern the beauty of holiness in the word, but to discern also, the image of the truth made on the heart, so that by his illumination, the believer is enabled to look back on his past experience, and to see, that, from time to time, he has exercised true faith, love, etc.; or, that he now actually is in the exercise of these graces. I do not, however, see any reason to doubt that God may sometimes, without any examination or comparison of its exercises with the marks of his word, fill the soul of the believer with a joyful persuasion of his love, and may so pour into it the spirit of adoption, that it shall be enabled, with filial confidence, to cry, <a href='../../../rf/gl/a.html#abba' target='gl'>Abba</a>, Father. Many testimonies to this purpose might be collected from the experience of saints.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">But alas! many serious, conscientious persons are always more or less under a cloud of doubt and uncertainty, respecting their spiritual condition. These broken reeds must not be crushed, nor this smoking flax quenched, by any doctrine of ours; for often among these are found the truly contrite and humble spirits with whom Jehovah delights to take up his abode. Where doubting does not arise from any want of confidence in the truth of God's word, but altogether from diffidence of the genuineness of our own faith, it does not partake of the nature of unbelief; for there is so much reason to distrust our own hearts, that this timidity and uncertainty is often rather an evidence of self-knowledge and humility, than of unbelief. Still, such persons are deprived of much comfort, which Christians ought to enjoy.</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='152'>152</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">These doubts are very distressing, and do not qualify the person to exhibit the bright side of religion to those around him. No person should be contented to remain under this dark cloud which so obscures his future prospects. Assurance of salvation is attainable by all true believers who assiduously seek it. Let all then strive to obtain this inestimable blessing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The true doctrine of assurance is taught in the Westminster Larger Catechism, and is clearly expressed in the following words, "Such as truly believe in Christ, and endeavour to walk in all good conscience before Him, may, without extraordinary revelation, by faith grounded on the truth of God's promises, and by the Spirit enabling them to discern in themselves those graces to which the promises of life are made, and bearing witness with their spirits that they are the children of God, be infallibly assured that they are in a state of grace, and shall persevere therein unto salvation." [LC 80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Again, "Assurance of grace and salvation, not being of the essence of faith, true believers may wait long before they obtain it; and after the enjoyment thereof, may have it weakened and intermitted through manifold distempers, sins, temptations and desertions; yet are they never left without such a presence and support of the Spirit of God, as keeps them from sinking into utter despair." [LC 81]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">That assurance of salvation is attainable in this life, is very evident from the Scriptures, both of the Old and New Testaments. Indeed, all the saints, of whom any expression of their spiritual state is recorded, appear to have possessed a full sense of their reconciliation and acceptance with God. The only doubt is, whether they owed their assurance to that supernatural inspiration which they possessed, or to</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='153'>153</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">clear revelations to them personally, that they were the adopted and beloved children of God. We know, that in some cases such communications were made to individual saints, as to Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaiah, and Daniel: but the mere possession of miraculous gifts furnished no decisive evidence of the spiritual state of the persons who had received these gifts. We know that Balaam, who loved the wages of unrighteousness, prophesied by the inspiration of God; and Judas, the traitor, received the same commission, to heal the sick, to cast out devils, and to raise the dead, as the other disciples. Moreover, our Lord assures us, that at the last day, some will make this a plea for admittance into his heavenly kingdom, that, in his name, they had cast out devils, and done many wonderful works; but He will say unto them, "Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity, I never knew you." [<a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/Matt/007.html#023' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/007/023.html' target='xr'>7:23</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Paul's strong assurance seems to have been the effect of that faith which he possessed in common with other Christians. And he felt it to be necessary to work out his salvation with fear and trembling, and to keep his body under, lest after preaching to others, he himself should become a castaway. His assurance of a crown of life at the appearing of Christ, was founded on the consciousness of having fought a good fight and kept the faith. The faith of the apostles was of the same kind with that of Christians at the present time: the only difference was in its strength. And as the apostles had nothing but what they had gratuitously received, there is no reason known to us, why God may not grant as great grace to some persons, in modern times, as was bestowed on the primitive Christians, or even on the apostles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">From the view of assurance which has been given</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='154'>154</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">above, it may be inferred, that the true reason why so many sincere Christians, in our day, live without assurance, is the feebleness of their faith. They need, therefore, to be exhorted, in the language of the apostle Peter, "Wherefore, the rather, brethren, give all diligence to make your calling and election sure." [<a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/2Pet/001.html#010' target='kj'>2 Pet</a> <a href='../../../xr/2Pet/001/010.html' target='xr'>1:10</a>] The apostle John teaches us how we may obtain this precious grace of assurance. "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren." [<a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/1John/003.html#014' target='kj'>1 John</a> <a href='../../../xr/1John/003/014.html' target='xr'>3:14</a>] "If our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God." [<a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/1John/003.html#021' target='kj'>1 John</a> <a href='../../../xr/1John/003/021.html' target='xr'>3:21</a>] "My little children let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him." [<a name='s10070' href='../../../kj/1John/003.html#018' target='kj'>1 John</a> <a href='../../../xr/1John/003/018.html' target='xr'>3:18</a>-19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Some exercised Christians fail to obtain assurance by mistaking the evidences of true piety; or rather by supposing that the working of inward corruption, of which they are conscious, is inconsistent with a state of grace. A correct knowledge of the marks and evidences of true religion, is of great importance, in order to our obtaining a settled assurance. And some humble Christians possess the blessing without giving it its proper name. The writer recollects a conversation which passed in his presence, between an eminent minister of the gospel, and an old lady who had been converted under the ministry of the Rev. Samuel Davies. This old lady had given indubitable evidence of eminent piety for more than half a century; but she said to the clergyman who was conversing with her, "I have never attained to the faith of assurance—mine is only the faith of reliance." To which the clergyman answered, "if you know you have the faith of reliance, you have the faith of assurance."</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Some persons seem to expect assurance in some</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='155'>155</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">extraordinary way, by an immediate divine revelation, or by a voice from heaven. But this is enthusiasm. Mr. Flavel makes mention of a young man who most earnestly sought for some extraordinary evidence of his acceptance with God; and as he walked in the fields vainly hoped, that the very stones would speak, that he might know whether he was a child of God. But afterwards, convinced of his error, he sought this blessing in the way of self-examination, reading the Scriptures, and other appointed means, and was not disappointed; for, in the use of instituted means, he attained to a settled and comfortable assurance of his interest in Christ. It may be remarked here, that assurance is not always accompanied with joy. There may be a scriptural conviction, that a work of divine grace has been experienced; and at the same time there may be no high raised affections; nor any very vigorous <a href='../../../rf/gl/a.html#actings' target='gl'>actings</a> of faith, at the moment. This may be called habitual assurance. But there is in the experience of many, at times, a joyful persuasion of the mercy and favour of God. This is probably what is meant by having "the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven." [<a name='s10080' href='../../../kj/Rom/005.html#005' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/005/005.html' target='xr'>5:5</a>] Such seasons are very precious, but never last long.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">It is a sad case, when assurance for a while enjoyed, is through sin or carelessness lost. This is often experienced by backsliders. Assurance can never be enjoyed by those who depart from God, even although the root of the matter be in them. And when a comfortable sense of the divine favour is lost, it is hard to be recovered. Such Christians often walk mournfully, with their heads bowed down as a bulrush, to the close of life. David after his <a href='../../../rf/gl/w.html#woful' target='gl'>woful</a> lapse, cries, "Cast me not away from thy presence, nor take thy</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='156'>156</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joys of thy salvation, and uphold me by thy free Spirit." [<a name='s10090' href='../../../kj/Ps/051.html#011' target='kj'>Ps</a> <a href='../../../xr/Ps/051/011.html' target='xr'>51:11</a>-12]—"Make me to hear joy and gladness, that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice." [<a name='s10100' href='../../../kj/Ps/051.html#008' target='kj'>Ps</a> <a href='../../../xr/Ps/051/008.html' target='xr'>51:8</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Many pious souls, there is reason to believe, are depressed, and their evidences beclouded, by a melancholy temperament. Physical causes necessarily have a powerful effect on the exercises of the mind; and this is felt in religion, as well as in other things.</p>
