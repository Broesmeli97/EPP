Can volunteer as readers for future EPP material. If you want to read a
particular book that EPP plans to release in the future, we can send you a
printed copy. You can read the book and note any errors you find.<br><br>
Can join our volunteer comparative proofreaders who check EPP-generated texts
against their source texts. This is the longest part of our processing, and
also the most valuable!<br><br>
Can volunteer as typists for very old or poorly-printed books that we cannot
digitally reproduce.<br><br>
Can produce useful subject lists from EPP material.<br><br>
Can make any suggestions about how to improve the product interface.<br><br>
Can collect and correlate biographical information about authors.<br><br>
Can prepare more accurate or more clear glossary definitions.<br><br>
Can report any errors or bugs they might find.<br><br>
Can volunteer as prep editors who carefully edit and correct EPP texts for
later proofreading.<br><br>
Can volunteer as HTML / Web experts to help solve EPP problems as well as
extending the online and CD-based Web sites.<br><br>

Sponsors</span></td>
<td class="TableEntry">
Individuals may have special affection for particular reformed works and want
to see them on the next EPP release for others to enjoy. Organizations (such as
churches, book clubs, historical and tract societies, etc.) may have it as part
of their mission to see particular authors or topics published.<br><br>
Such individuals and organizations may want to consider becoming EPP sponsors.
Sponsors volunteer any combination of funds, materials, volunteer time, etc. to
the EPP towards work on a specific printed work or works.<br><br>
In return, the EPP moves sponsored works to the front of the development line.
As long as there is such commissioned work available, the EPP will process it
as fast as possible and in preference to non-sponsored work.<br><br>
Special requests from individuals or organizations for particular works, in support of
kingdom ministry, even if not accompanied by offers of sponsorship, will be
given priority as available time and resources allow.<br>

<td class="TableEntry">
Creation of high-quality e-texts from older works is a very costly process. A
typical 500-page Puritan volume costs many thousands of dollars to convert from
its paper form to a faithful HTML file. The cost are incurred in the
following areas:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Labor</b> (either as real wages paid to staff or lost income opportunities of
volunteers)
<ul>
<li>Scanning
<li>Digital editing of scanned images
<li>Text editing prior to proofreading and between consecutive proofreads
<li>Comparative proofreading
<li>Traditional proofreading
<li>Computer programming fees
<li>CD production costs
<li>Administration
</ul>
<li><b>Materials and Equipment</b>
<ul>
<li>Source material
<ul>
<li>Expensive, antique books
<li>Modern reprints
</ul>
<li>Vast amounts of office paper to print the works (each work is usually
printed three or four times before it is finished) as well as cardstock and
acetate (for covers)
<li>Large quantities of toner cartridges
<li>Special text and image-handling software
<li>Office supplies (butterfly clips, binding posts, etc.)
<li>Equipment with mechanical components:
<ul>
<li>Scanners
<li>Printers
<li>Hard disks, CD Writers and other basic computer equipment
</ul>
<li>Significant mailing expense to move proofreading materials to and from the
proofreading staff and volunteers
</ul>
</ul>
In light of these costs, the EPP is very glad to receive direct assistance to
help move the Project forward at even greater speed and excellence. Probably
the best way to support us is to buy CDs and distribute them to those who can
use them.<br><br>
Sponsoring particular works (as mentioned above)
is also a very helpful way of assisting the EPP.<br><br>
Indirect forms of support are most welcome. We can use donated
materials, such as paper, toner cartridges, etc. The donation of source material is also very helpful. Please contact
us first on this, as we already have many hundreds of books, booklets, tracts, etc.<br>

<td class="TableEntry">
Many churches have either informal reading groups or formal classes which study
through particular books. The EPP can work with such efforts in a symbiotic way by providing
the books in electronic form (which saves the group the cost of buying the book.) The group can,
in return, help the EPP by reporting any defects that they find in the text as the study proceeds.<br><br>
Many churches have deacon-oriented needs where direct support is either
scripturally or practically undesirable. The EPP is willing to work
with churches so that young widows, deserted family members, prison inmates,
etc. can receive benevolent aid via work done for the EPP. In this way, the
Christian ethic of working to support oneself is learned, and useful kingdom
work gets done at the same time.<br><br>
Churches may have special pastoral or didactic needs for particular works. This
may include creating special printed publications, such as tracts or booklets,
from larger works. For example, a congregation may be planning a conference on
being a biblical husband and may want to have a booklet or workbook created
using William Gouge's Treatise on the Husband from his massive work on the
family, <i>Domestic Duties</i>. The EPP is glad to entertain such
requests.<br><br>
Any interest in hosting EPP on your church book table or at special
conferences would also be warmly entertained.

<td class="TableEntry">
One of our significant project goals is to help seminaries which
truly believe and teach that the Bible is the word of the only living and true
God. In the long term, we hope that all the materials needed by students for their course work could
be provided on a single CD or DVD. Many young seminarians are on small,
fixed budgets, and we would like to eliminate most of their book costs. We would also hope that
the organization and utility of the EPP CD would help
enhance the speed, span and accuracy of their theological study.<br><br>

The EPP is happy to give special attention and priority to works required by
seminaries, even without any elements of sponsorship or contributions.<br><br>

Individual students studying theology for the ministry are welcome to contact
the EPP for assistance. With enough early notification, the EPP is frequently
willing to purchase a book on behalf of a student, convert it into an e-text,
and give it to the student free-of-charge. All that the project asks in return
is that the student report back defects encountered in the use of the material,
so that the EPP can improve its quality.<br><br>

Another idea we have been considering is the integrating of seminary curriculum
and reading lists into a project CD. If a seminary is interested in having their
curriculum laid out as part of EPP or a special EPP release, please contact us.

Publishers! Thank you for keeping the old books alive! The EPP would like to help
and support publishers as much as possible.<br><br>

The EPP can provide a fresh e-text (without Roman numerals, printing marks or
printing errors) to publishers who are interested in republishing a particular book, perhaps
in exchange for an acknowledgement or assistance with proofreading. Some publishers may already
have several e-texts, but want or need more. The EPP would be glad to entertain e-text "trades" in
such cases.
<br><br>
The EPP is currently undertaking republishing projects with Christian Research
Press (<i>The King James Version Defended</i> by Edward F. Hills) and
Reformation Heritage Books (<i>A Compendium Of Bible Truth</i> by Archibald
Alexander, and others). Other publishers are welcome to join the effort!

As you may know, some people do not prefer to read long stretches of material
on a computer screen. If you would be interested in seeing your work on a
future version of the EPP CD, where your potential audience can sample your
work and your existing readers can use the EPP CD as an integrator and
locator tool, please get in touch with us. Most (or
all) modern authors who give away "e-book" versions of their works end up
selling even more paper copies!
