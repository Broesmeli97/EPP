<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center" style="text-align:center" class="msonormal"><span style="letter-spacing:1.0pt">GOOD WORKS; OR, CHRISTIAN DUTIES</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">"Truth is in order to goodness;" and the great touchstone of truth, is, its tendency to promote holiness, according to the Saviour's rule, "By their fruits shall ye know them." [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/Matt/007.html#020' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/007/020.html' target='xr'>7:20</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Good works are such as the law of God requires to be performed by all persons, according to the relations in which they stand, and the positive precepts which he has enjoined, and which are in force at the time. They have been commonly divided into three classes, the duties which we owe to God, to our <a href='../../../rf/gl/n.html#neighbour' target='gl'>neighbour</a>, and to ourselves; but in strict propriety of speech, all our duties, whoever may be the object, are due to God. He is our Lawgiver, and we are under the moral government of no other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Though Christ fulfilled the <a name='g10020' href='../../../rf/gl/p.html#preceptive' target='gl'>preceptive</a> part of the law in the room of God's chosen people, yet he did not thereby free them from the obligation of obedience to the moral law. Such a release from moral obligation is inconceivable; for it is impossible that a creature should not be under obligations to love and honour his Creator; but if such exemption from law were possible, it would be no blessing but a curse; for our happiness consists in conformity to the law of God. "In keeping thy commandments, there is a great reward." [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/Ps/019.html#011' target='kj'>Ps</a> <a href='../../../xr/Ps/019/011.html' target='xr'>19:11</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">As the obligation to obedience cannot be removed, so neither can the requisitions of the law, as some</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='139'>139</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">suppose, be lowered. Man must ever be as much bound to love God with the whole heart, as to love him at all. If man had fulfilled the condition of the first covenant, which required perfect obedience during his probation, he would not have been free from moral obligation to obedience, in consequence of his justification. Angels, who are supposed to be now confirmed in happiness, are as much under obligation to love God as ever. Indeed, as has been hinted, holiness and happiness are inseparable. The Holy Scriptures abound in exhortations to Christians to be diligent, zealous, and persevering in the performance of the respective duties of their stations; in the performance of which, divine aid may be asked, and confidently expected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Some duties are incumbent on all classes of people; such as the worship of God, doing good to men, and abstaining from every thing which would have a tendency to dishonour Christ, to injure our <a href='../../../rf/gl/n.html#neighbour' target='gl'>neighbour</a>, or hinder our own usefulness and improvement. Two things especially are incumbent on all, in relation to their fellow-creatures residing on the earth with them. The first is, the communication of saving knowledge to such as are so unfortunate as to be destitute of this precious treasure. This is a duty of universal obligation, though the means proper to be used by different persons will vary, according to the variety of the circumstances in which they are placed. It is the duty of all Christians to "let their conversation be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that it may minister grace to the hearers." [<a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/Col/004.html#006' target='kj'>Col</a> <a href='../../../xr/Col/004/006.html' target='xr'>4:6</a>; <a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/Eph/004.html#029' target='kj'>Eph</a> <a href='../../../xr/Eph/004/029.html' target='xr'>4:29</a>] It is also made their duty to exhort and admonish one another, and that daily, lest any be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. All Christians are bound also to teach by example as well as by precept, by exhibiting to</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='140'>140</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">the view of all who see them a holy life. "Let," says Paul, "your conversation be such as becometh the gospel." [<a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/Phil/001.html#027' target='kj'>Phil</a> <a href='../../../xr/Phil/001/027.html' target='xr'>1:27</a>] And our blessed Lord in his sermon on the mount, commands: "Let your light so shine, that others seeing your good works, may glorify your Father who is in heaven." [<a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/Matt/005.html#016' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/005/016.html' target='xr'>5:16</a>] It is evident from the very nature of this duty, which arises from our obligation to love our <a href='../../../rf/gl/n.html#neighbour' target='gl'>neighbour</a> as ourselves, that all Christians are bound to send the gospel to those who are destitute of this necessary means of salvation; for, "how can they hear without a preacher, and how can they preach except they be sent?" [<a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/Rom/010.html#014' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/010/014.html' target='xr'>10:14</a>-15] All, therefore, according to their ability, should contribute toward this object, by supporting missionaries, aiding in the printing and circulation of Bibles and evangelical tracts, and maintaining institutions of learning for the training of ministers. But this duty of diffusing abroad the precious seed of divine truth, devolves especially on those who have been called to the holy ministry, who have been ordained for this very purpose, to publish to every creature the gospel of the grace of God. When a dispensation of the gospel is committed to any one, he will incur a fearful load of guilt if he turn aside to any secular employment. This may be learned from many things left on record by the apostle Paul. He calls God to witness that he was free from the blood of all men at Ephesus, because he had not ceased to declare unto them repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ; evidently intimating, that if he had not been thus faithful and diligent, he would have incurred, the guilt of their destruction; which is exactly in accordance with what is said respecting the unfaithful watchman in <a name='s10070' href='../../../kj/Ezek/033.html#001' target='kj'>Ezek</a> <a href='../../../xr/Ezek/033/001.html' target='xr'>33:1</a>-9. The duty of preaching, to</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='141'>141</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">those who are called and have undertaken the office, is not optional, which is evident from what Paul says, in another place, "<a href='../../../rf/gl/w.html#wo' target='gl'>Wo</a> is me, if I preach not the gospel." [<a name='s10080' href='../../../kj/1Cor/009.html#016' target='kj'>1 Cor</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Cor/009/016.html' target='xr'>9:16</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Others, who have the instruction of youth committed to them, are under peculiar obligations to <a name='g10060' href='../../../rf/gl/i.html#instil' target='gl'>instil</a> into their opening minds the doctrines of God's holy word. Parents, guardians of orphans, masters of servants or apprentices, and teachers of schools of every kind, are bound by this obligation, from which no human laws can exempt them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Another duty of universal obligation is, to pray to God for his blessing on all the nations of the earth; and especially on kings and all that are in authority, not only that they may obtain salvation, but that Christians under a wise and equitable administration of law, "may lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godliness and honesty." [<a name='s10090' href='../../../kj/1Tim/002.html#002' target='kj'>1 Tim</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Tim/002/002.html' target='xr'>2:2</a>] All are bound to join cordially and fervently in the public prayers of the church, and not to neglect the assembling themselves together, as the manner of some is. We have encouragement also to agree together in smaller associations for prayer; and are assured that Christ will be present in such meetings, and that the concordant prayers there offered, will be graciously answered. And who can doubt, that, as we are commanded "to pray without ceasing," [<a name='s10100' href='../../../kj/1Thess/005.html#017' target='kj'>1 Thess</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Thess/005/017.html' target='xr'>5:17</a>] and "to pray every where, lifting up holy hands," [<a name='s10110' href='../../../kj/1Tim/002.html#008' target='kj'>1 Tim</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Tim/002/008.html' target='xr'>2:8</a>] family prayer is an incumbent duty? But in addition to all these, "we should enter into our closets, and shut the door, and pray to our Father in secret; and our Father who seeth in secret will reward us openly." [<a name='s10120' href='../../../kj/Matt/006.html#006' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/006/006.html' target='xr'>6:6</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Among the prescribed duties of Christians, there is none which is more solemnly and emphatically inculcated, than a compassionate regard to the poor and</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='142'>142</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">afflicted. Indeed, the phrase "good works," is most commonly employed in Scripture, in relation to this single thing. In this we follow the example of Christ, "who went about doing good," [<a name='s10130' href='../../../kj/Acts/010.html#038' target='kj'>Acts</a> <a href='../../../xr/Acts/010/038.html' target='xr'>10:38</a>] by preaching the gospel to the poor, and by relieving the distresses of the afflicted. And it is the assiduous performance of this duty which recommends the gospel to the judgment and conscience of men, more than any thing else. "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father, is to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world." [<a name='s10140' href='../../../kj/James/001.html#027' target='kj'>James</a> <a href='../../../xr/James/001/027.html' target='xr'>1:27</a>] Nothing more is necessary to convince us of the importance of this duty, than the representation given by our Saviour, of the process of the judgment recorded in <a name='s10150' href='../../../kj/Matt/025.html#000' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/025/000.html' target='xr'>25</a>, where the destiny of the assembled race of men is made to turn upon the kindness shown to the disciples of Christ. "Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me." [<a name='s10160' href='../../../kj/Matt/025.html#034' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/025/034.html' target='xr'>25:34</a>-36] And, in answer to their inquiry, when they had done any of these things to him? he said, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." [<a name='s10170' href='../../../kj/Matt/025.html#040' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/025/040.html' target='xr'>25:40</a>] And to the wicked, the neglect of this duty is alone mentioned as the ground of condemnation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Among the good works which Christians are required to perform, relative duties hold a very conspicuous place. These, indeed, in number, greatly exceed all other Christian duties, and no day passes in which every one has not duties of this kind to perform.</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='143'>143</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">But, as the relations of men are very much diversified by their condition in life, and standing in society, these duties are not the same to all persons. One is a parent, another a child; one is a magistrate, another a citizen; one is a pastor, another a member of his flock; one is a master, another a servant; one is a husband, another a wife. Besides these, there are particular professions and occupations in life; or offices in the church and state, all which relations give rise to duties, which are incumbent on all who sustain these various relations. It <a href='../../../rf/gl/b.html#behoves' target='gl'>behoves</a> the Christian to be conscientious and faithful in the discharge of all relative duties. And, as there is a necessity for intercourse and commerce among men, the virtues of justice and veracity should be constantly <a href='../../../rf/gl/p.html#practised' target='gl'>practised</a>, "doing unto others as we would have them do unto us." [<a name='s10180' href='../../../kj/Luke/006.html#031' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/006/031.html' target='xr'>6:31</a>] And, in social intercourse, to promote good fellowship, there should be real kindness, respectfulness, <a href='../../../rf/gl/c.html#candour' target='gl'>candour</a>, and courtesy, assiduously cultivated. The standing rule should be, to do nothing and say nothing which would tend to the injury of our <a href='../../../rf/gl/n.html#neighbour' target='gl'>neighbour</a>; but continually to seek to promote his best interests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Man is utterly unable to perform works of supererogation. When he has done all that is commanded, he must acknowledge himself to be an unprofitable servant; having done no more than it was his duty to do.</p>
