<p align="center" style="text-align:center" class="msonormal"><span style="letter-spacing:1.0pt">PERSONALITY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">The Divinity of the Holy Spirit may be established by arguments of the same kind as have been adduced in support of the Deity of the Son; but it does not seem necessary to go over the same ground again; especially, as at the present there are none, as far as we know, who maintain that the Holy Spirit is a created being. Anti-<a name='g10010' href='../../../rf/gl/t.html#trinitarians' target='gl'>trinitarians</a> of the present day, admit that the Spirit is divine, but not a distinct person from the Father. As the spirit of a man is the man himself, so they think that the Spirit of God is God, or the wisdom or power of God. Another reason why it is not necessary now to enter into an elaborate argument to establish the divinity of the Spirit is, that reason makes no greater objection to a Trinity than a duality in the Godhead. If the proofs of the deity of the Son are conclusive, the same kind of evidence will readily be received in favour of a third person. We shall, therefore, occupy the space which can be allotted for this point, to a consideration</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='51'>51</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">of the proofs of the distinct personality of the Holy Spirit. And here the reader will recollect the observations made respecting the sense in which the word person is used, when applied to the divine essence. We do not pretend that we are able to form definite and clear conceptions on this subject. Among creatures, where we find an intelligent, voluntary agent, we call that being a person. And such persons are spoken of by proper names, and by personal pronouns, which are used instead of the name. John is possessed of reason and will, and he pursues such objects as are agreeable to his taste. John is a person. Every one who is constituted like John, however he may differ from him in other respects, is also called a person. We find in Scripture three, to whom divine attributes and works are ascribed, and each of whom has an appropriate name, and is frequently represented as acting, feeling, and speaking; and to each of these the pronouns used in reference to persons are often applied. And they are not different names of the same person, because they are, in a number of cases, all mentioned in the same sentence; and they are represented as speaking to each other, and as sending or promising to send another. And there are appropriate acts ascribed to each. It cannot be supposed, that, if the Holy Spirit were not a distinct person, this mode of speaking of him, in the Holy Scriptures, would be kept up whenever he is mentioned. Sometimes, by a lively figure, that which is not a person is personified, and introduced as thinking, feeling, seeing, hearing, and speaking; but no one is ever deceived by this liberty of speech; but if this personification were kept up whenever this inanimate, unintelligent being was mentioned, it would tend only to confusion and error.</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='52'>52</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">But this is never done in regard to such beings as are not possessed of intelligence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Let it then be kept distinctly in view, that the Holy Spirit is either a person, or a divine attribute, as none now are found maintaining that the Holy Spirit is a creature; and if he were, he would still be a person. What we now wish to establish is, the distinct personality of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The personality of the <a name='g10020' href='../../../rf/gl/p.html#paraclete' target='gl'>Paraclete</a>, who is the Holy Ghost, is exceedingly manifest from the words of Christ, where he promises to pray the Father to send the Holy Spirit, (<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/John/014.html#016' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/014/016.html' target='xr'>14:16</a>-17,) where the personal pronoun is used to designate the Holy Ghost, no less than six times, in two verses. "And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever: Even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you." And again, in <a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/John/014.html#026' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/014/026.html' target='xr'>14:26</a>, "But the Comforter, (<a name='g10030' href='../../../rf/gl/p.html#paraclete' target='gl'>Paraclete</a>,) which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things," etc. Also, in <a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/John/016.html#007' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/016/007.html' target='xr'>16:7</a>-14. "Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: Of sin, because they believe not on me; of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. <a href='../../../rf/gl/h.html#howbeit' target='gl'>Howbeit</a>, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='53'>53</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you." In this last passage, the personal pronoun is applied to the Holy Spirit, nearly a dozen times. And there is a peculiar force in the original, which cannot be preserved in English. The Greek word for <i>Spirit</i> is of the neuter gender, but the inspired writer, instead of making use of a pronoun of the corresponding gender, constantly uses the pronoun of the masculine gender. No conceivable reason can be assigned for this, except that the Spirit is really a person, a divine person, and therefore should be represented by the masculine pronoun.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">How would it sound to attribute to any divine attribute, or operation, what is ascribed to the Holy Spirit, throughout the Scriptures? "I will pray to the Father, and he will send his wisdom, and he shall teach you all things. He will not speak of himself, but he will take of mine and shew it unto you. And when wisdom is come, he will convince the world of sin, of righteousness, and judgment." "Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie unto Wisdom?" "He that blasphemeth against Wisdom, it shall never be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come." "As Wisdom said by David." "Wisdom said, separate me Barnabas and Saul to the work to which I have appointed them." "I baptize you in the name of the Father, Son, and Wisdom." "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of Wisdom, be with you all." The same incongruity, or rather absurdity, would follow from substituting any other word expressive,</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='54'>54</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">not of a person, but an attribute, or an influence, or operation, for the name of Holy Ghost, or Holy Spirit, in all the places where it occurs. We never can receive the Sacred Scriptures as a certain rule of faith, intended to guide all classes of people, without admitting that the Holy Spirit is spoken of as a person. It is true, there are passages in which, if there were no others, we might be led to suppose that the Spirit was a gift, or divine influence shed on the minds of men; but all these texts can be much more easily explained, so as to harmonize with those which ascribe personal acts to the Holy Spirit, than those be reconciled to the hypothesis that the Spirit is an attribute, or an influence. When we read of the Spirit dwelling in us, being given without measure, being quenched, etc., it is easy to understand that the operations and influences of this divine agent are intended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">We conclude then, that, according to a fair interpretation of the Holy Scriptures, there are three persons, each being made known by a distinct name, and to each operations and offices ascribed, which are peculiar; and yet, in all works, there is a perfect concurrence of three distinct agents. And as we have clear evidence, that there is one God, and none beside, and as to each of the three, divine attributes are ascribed in Scripture, these three must be one God, although in what way they are one and three we do not know, and do not pretend to explain. It is, however, no greater mystery than God's eternity, self-existence, and omnipresence. All we need to know is, what God hath declared in his word. Hath Christ said, "I and my Father are one," [<a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/John/010.html#030' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/010/030.html' target='xr'>10:30</a>] and shall we not believe it, although we cannot understand nor explain how they are one? Christ says, "He that</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='55'>55</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">hath seen me, hath seen the Father." [<a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/John/014.html#009' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/014/009.html' target='xr'>14:9</a>] Here are two, the Father and the Son, and yet they are so identified, that he that hath seen the one, hath seen the other also. Here is a fact plainly stated; this we are bound to believe; but how this can be, or what is the nature of this union, we are not required to understand, or to believe any thing respecting its nature. And if the Father and the Son are one God, the Holy Spirit, to whom divine attributes and works are also ascribed, must be one with the Father and the Son. Indeed, Unitarians admit this now. They agree that the Holy Spirit is God himself. His personality, however, they deny. But we have proved that the Holy Spirit is a person, because he is constantly spoken of as performing the acts which none but a person can perform. Let it be admitted, that the word <i>person</i>, in application to the Spirit, must not be taken in the same precise, definite sense, as when applied to men and angels. The Spirit searches葉he Spirit understands葉he Spirit speaks葉he Spirit calls and appoints to the ministry葉he Spirit reproves, teaches, guides, comforts, intercedes, inspires, sanctifies耀heds abroad the love of God. The Spirit witnesses with our spirits葉he Spirit quickens葉he Spirit may be grieved洋ay be sinned against, distinctly from sins against the Son.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">What an adorable being is the Triune God! How gloriously mysterious in his being, attributes, operations, and personal acts! How little are we capable of knowing of this infinite Being. "None by searching can find out the Almighty to perfection." [<a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/Job/011.html#007' target='kj'>Job</a> <a href='../../../xr/Job/011/007.html' target='xr'>11:7</a>] Where the feelings of the heart are right, the incomprehensible</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='56'>56</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">nature of the divine existence causes no obstruction to genuine devotion. Indeed, the soul of man is so constituted as to require an incomprehensible Being as the object of worship. Profound adoration is the very feeling which corresponds with this attribute. Were it not so, the angels in heaven would be perplexed and unhappy; for the more is known of God, the more mysteries are perceived in the divine character. "Clouds and darkness are around about him, but justice and judgment are the habitation of his throne." [<a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/Ps/097.html#002' target='kj'>Ps</a> <a href='../../../xr/Ps/097/002.html' target='xr'>97:2</a>] He is also represented as "dwelling in light which is inaccessible," [<a name='s10070' href='../../../kj/1Tim/006.html#016' target='kj'>1 Tim</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Tim/006/016.html' target='xr'>6:16</a>] and to which no mortal can approach. How condescending is God to furnish us with an object of worship in our own nature, where the attributes of Deity shine forth in the face of a man like ourselves. This is truly the grand mystery of Godliness; "God manifest in the flesh;" [<a name='s10080' href='../../../kj/1Tim/003.html#016' target='kj'>1 Tim</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Tim/003/016.html' target='xr'>3:16</a>] "the <a href='../../../rf/gl/f.html#fulness' target='gl'>fulness</a> of the Godhead dwelling in Christ;" [<a name='s10090' href='../../../kj/Col/002.html#009' target='kj'>Col</a> <a href='../../../xr/Col/002/009.html' target='xr'>2:9</a>] so that he is both God and man in the same person. And perhaps this mode of exhibiting the divine attributes in humanity may be of unspeakable importance to all intelligent creatures in heaven. It may have given them an opportunity of knowing much more of God than they ever knew before, or could know in any other way. The doctrine of redemption is not only useful to the redeemed, but to all the hierarchy of heaven. No creature can know any thing of the nature of God but what he is pleased to reveal; and the method by which he makes himself known, is by his works and dispensations. No creature can penetrate the divine essence, and search the deep things of God. That the Son knows the Father, as he is known by him, furnishes a conclusive argument of his divinity. And that the Spirit searcheth the deep things of God, is also a sure argument of his divinity.</p>
