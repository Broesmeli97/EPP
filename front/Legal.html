Legal Provisions

<span style="font-size: 12pt ">
<b>Product Licensing</b><br><br>
<p>EPP products are made available for the use of one person at a time. (In other words, treat them like books.) Legitimate owners may loan them to other users and may even copy them onto the hard disk storage of several different computers, as long as <i>only one person is using the material at any given time</i>.</p>
<p>For example, one might have the EPP CD copied onto a home computer’s hard
disk and also copied onto a machine at a work-place. Since a commute
separates the use of the material, this is fine. But a family member using the home copy while one is using the work copy would not be
appropriate. In pooled or group situations, such as classrooms, there should be one EPP product per machine. It would not matter how many distinct students are using the machines over time.</p>
<br><br>

<b>Digital Text Licensing</b><br><br>
<p>The republication of EPP digital texts for commercial or <b><i>non-commercial</i></b> purposes is not allowed without permission. These texts are copyrighted and the EPP reserves the right to employ stealthy, text-tracing in order to detect and legally prosecute the theft of its work. Such text-tracers are extremely difficult to expunge and it is generally more difficult to evade them than it is to create a brand new, quality e-text from scratch. If there should be any ambitious e-text kidnappers out there, we say, "why not spend your energy working <i>with</i> us to create new material rather than stealing or duplicating our existing work?"</p>

<p>Ministers who are preparing sermons, scholars who are developing papers, and
students who are doing reports are welcome to copy and paste "fair use" amounts of EPP text for illustrations, footnoting, etc., provided the use is not directly for
profit nor disproportionate in size. Attributions back to the EPP are much
appreciated, when appropriate.</p>
