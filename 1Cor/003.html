<a name='001' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/001.html' target='xr'>1.</a> And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, <i>even</i> as unto babes in Christ.<br>
<a name='002' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able <i>to bear it</i>, neither yet now are ye able.<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> For ye are yet carnal: for whereas <i>there is</i> among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I <i>am</i> of Apollos; are ye not carnal?<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> Who then is Paul, and who <i>is</i> Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?<br>
<a name='006' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/006.html' target='xr'>6.</a> I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.<br>
<a name='007' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, <i>ye are</i> God's building.<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;<br>
<a name='013' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/013.html' target='xr'>13.</a> Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.<br>
<a name='014' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/014.html' target='xr'>14.</a> If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.<br>
<a name='015' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/015.html' target='xr'>15.</a> If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.<br>
<a name='016' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/016.html' target='xr'>16.</a> Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and <i>that</i> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<br>
<a name='017' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/017.html' target='xr'>17.</a> If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which <i>temple</i> ye are.<br>
<a name='018' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/018.html' target='xr'>18.</a> Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.<br>
<a name='019' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/019.html' target='xr'>19.</a> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.<br>
<a name='020' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/020.html' target='xr'>20.</a> And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.<br>
<a name='021' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/021.html' target='xr'>21.</a> Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;<br>
<a name='022' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/022.html' target='xr'>22.</a> Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;<br>
<a name='023' href='../../xr/1Cor/003/023.html' target='xr'>23.</a> And ye are Christ's; and Christ <i>is</i> God's.<br>
