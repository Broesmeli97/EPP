<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center" style="text-align:center" class="msonormal"><span style="letter-spacing:1.0pt">THE HOLY TRINITY</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">The Scriptural evidence of this doctrine would not be deemed insufficient by any one, were it not for the idea that there is something in the doctrine repugnant to reason; or, which it is very difficult to reconcile to right reason. The only thing then, which reason has to do with the subject is, to examine whether there is any thing in the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity, which is manifestly repugnant to any truth clearly ascertained by the use of right reason. It is admitted that this doctrine is not known by the light of nature; for even if there should be found in the material universe, or in the human mind, a resemblance to the Trinity, as some have supposed, this resemblance, if admitted would furnish no conclusive argument in favour of the doctrine. It is not pretended that the doctrine is either made known, or can be proved by reasoning. It is a doctrine of pure revelation. But if its opponents could show that it contradicted any clear and universally acknowledged principles of truth, we should be reduced to the necessity of either rejecting the Bible, which teaches the doctrine, or of so interpreting the Scriptures, as to exclude the absurd opinion. The first course is pursued by deists, who often give this as a sufficient reason for rejecting the Bible, that it contains doctrines contrary to reason. Jews and <a name='g10010' href='../../../rf/gl/m.html#mohammedans' target='gl'>Mohammedans</a></p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='35'>35</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">are found making the same objection. But all Anti-<a name='g10020' href='../../../rf/gl/t.html#trinitarian' target='gl'>trinitarian</a> Christians adopt the second course. They admit the evidences of divine revelation to be convincing, and they therefore receive the Scriptures as a true revelation. But, as they think that this doctrine is contrary to reason, they determine that it cannot be the doctrine of divine revelation; and in consequence, exert all their force to destroy the authority of such texts as seem to contain it; or so interpret them, that they may speak a different language. It seems necessary, therefore, to inquire, whether, indeed, there is any thing in the doctrine of the Trinity palpably contradictory, or evidently incompatible with evident principles of reason. Here it is important to distinguish between doctrines which are above reason, and those which are contrary to reason. That many things which are certainly true are above reason, must be admitted by every rational man that will consider the subject. That God is without beginning is as certain a truth as any which could be mentioned, and yet it is above reason. Who can comprehend a duration without a beginning? And from this incomprehensible truth, even atheism would give no relief; for the atheist is obliged to admit that something has existed from eternity, unless he choose to say that all existing things originated without cause, which would be still more incomprehensible. That God is every where present is admitted by Unitarians; and yet they must maintain that there can be no diffusion of the divine essence through the parts of space; but that the whole Deity is every where. Is not this above reason? And who can comprehend the divine omniscience? Indeed, as all the attributes of God are infinite, that very term shows that they transcend human reason;</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='36'>36</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">for no finite mind can comprehend that which is infinite. There are also facts which relate to our own existence, the truth of which we know certainly, and yet we are utterly unable to comprehend them. Who can explain the true cause of muscular motion in the human body? Nothing is more certain in our experience than that our minds and bodies are intimately united, so that they constantly and reciprocally affect each other. How it is that we perceive by the eye, hear by the ear, distinguish tastes by the tongue, or odours by the smell, are all mysteries. They are truths, but they are above reason. Now it is readily admitted, that the doctrine of a Trinity, in the divine essence, falls into the class of incomprehensible truths. We know it to be a truth, because God, who cannot lie, has plainly declared it; but <i>how</i> it is, or how it can be, is above our comprehension, just as some of the fundamental truths of natural religion, which have been mentioned, are above reason.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">It is however alleged, that God's being at the same time one and three is plainly repugnant to reason; the proposition containing a palpable contradiction. This statement <a name='g10030' href='../../../rf/gl/t.html#trinitarians' target='gl'>Trinitarians</a> utterly deny; and certainly the external evidence is very much against it; for much the greater number of wise and impartial men, who have carefully examined the subject since Christianity was introduced, have believed in the doctrine of the Trinity. But let us examine this objection, and see whether it has any foundation. If <a name='g10040' href='../../../rf/gl/t.html#trinitarians' target='gl'>Trinitarians</a> asserted that the persons of the Trinity were three and one, in the same sense, there would indeed be an evident contradiction; but this is so far from being the fact, that all writers on the subject are careful to state, that while there are</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='37'>37</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">three distinctions, called <i>persons</i>, there is but one essence. But it is alleged, that if there be three <i>persons</i>, there must be three Gods; for a <i>person</i> is a distinct, intelligent and voluntary agent; and if there be three distinct, intelligent, voluntary agents, there must be three Gods. But who can show it to involve any contradiction that three equal <a name='g10050' href='../../../rf/gl/i.html#intelligences' target='gl'>intelligences</a> should be united in the possession of a common essence? But the whole force of this objection arises from taking the word <i>person</i> in a strict and definite sense, as used when applied to men; whereas, we are under no necessity of retaining this word; it is not found in Scripture, and many <a name='g10060' href='../../../rf/gl/t.html#trinitarians' target='gl'>Trinitarians</a> have rejected it. There may be three in the divine essence, and yet these may not with much propriety be called persons. Still, in our opinion, there is no need to depart from the terms commonly made use of by <a name='g10070' href='../../../rf/gl/t.html#trinitarians' target='gl'>Trinitarians</a>. Some term is necessary to designate the three, and there is no objection to the word <i>person</i>, which would not exist in full force against any other word; and this term has the sanction of long usage, and is found in almost every writer on the subject. All that is necessary is, as in analogous cases, to explain the sense in which the word is used in application to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. And here it should be remembered, that all our language which we use to designate the attributes of God, is necessarily inadequate; and the most common words in application to the Deity have a peculiar meaning. This is the fact when we use the words intellect, will, purpose, love, etc. God's understanding is infinitely different from ours; the will of God cannot be understood as precisely similar to will in the human mind. And in regard to affections and passions this is so evident, that many, to</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='38'>38</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">avoid the ascription of any imperfection to the Supreme Being, have denied to him every kind of affection, as well as passion. But, in the use of such terms, it should be considered that they must not be taken definitely and strictly, as they apply to man, but as representing vaguely and indefinitely something in God which resembles those things in man for which these words stand. And no other rule, in the use of the term <i>person</i>, is necessary, when the word is used in relation to the Supreme Being, than what is necessary in many other cases. The word <i>person</i> is used merely to mark a distinction evidently made in Scripture, and may, in this indefinite sense, be properly used; because, in relation to Father, Son, and Spirit, personal pronouns are used, and personal acts are ascribed to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The question respecting the truth of the Trinity is, however, not to be confounded with the one respecting the propriety of the use of the word <i>persons</i>, which some who hold the doctrine of the Trinity firmly, have rejected. And some, who nevertheless believed in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as being divine, have scrupled to use the word Trinity, because it is not found in Holy Scripture. Now, while men receive implicitly all that is taught in Scripture respecting each of these, we need not contend with them about the theological terms which shall be employed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Though the Trinity is not a doctrine discoverable by reason, yet we find some vestiges of it in nearly all ancient systems of Pagan theology, which seems to indicate that it was handed down by tradition from the earliest ages of the world. But we do not adduce this as a fact likely to have any weight with the anti-<a name='g10080' href='../../../rf/gl/t.html#trinitarian' target='gl'>trinitarian</a>. Indeed, some have ingeniously</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='39'>39</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">founded an argument against the doctrine from its resemblance to <a name='g10090' href='../../../rf/gl/p.html#platonism' target='gl'>Platonism</a>, and other Pagan systems. But still, no more reasonable account of the triad, found in most ancient theories of religion, can be given, than by supposing an early tradition to have been received on this subject. Our appeal, however, must be to the infallible oracles of divine revelation; and although we find many vestiges of a plurality of persons in the Godhead, in the Old Testament, yet as these are not so evident but that they are liable to dispute, it will save time to proceed at once to the testimonies which are found in the New Testament. And our first object will be to show, that three persons are often mentioned together, by three distinct names; and then we will bring convincing, arguments to prove that each of these is God; and there being but one God, as we have seen, these three must, in some mysterious way, be united in one essence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">At the baptism of Christ, the Father <a href='../../../rf/gl/s.html#spake' target='gl'>spake</a> from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased;" [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/Matt/003.html#017' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/003/017.html' target='xr'>3:17</a>; <a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/Mark/001.html#011' target='kj'>Mark</a> <a href='../../../xr/Mark/001/011.html' target='xr'>1:11</a>] and the Holy Ghost descended on Christ in the form of a dove. Here then we have Christ visible in the form of man, the Father speaking of the Son in a voice from heaven, and the Holy Ghost, in a visible form, descending on Christ. Whatever may be determined respecting the nature of these persons, they are manifestly three in number. The Holy Ghost did not speak, and the Father did speak, but did not descend in a visible form; and, evidently, the Son was not the person who spoke or descended. This evident manifestation of three persons at the baptism of Christ, led one of the Christian fathers to exclaim, "Let him who would have a proof of the Trinity go to Jordan."</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='40'>40</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The clear distinction of the persons of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is again most evidently set forth in Christ's consolatory discourse to his disciples, before he suffered, recorded in <a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/John/014.html#000' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/014/000.html' target='xr'>14</a>-16, and also in his intercessory prayer, <a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/John/017.html#000' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/017/000.html' target='xr'>17</a>. "And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that shall abide with you forever; even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you." [<a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/John/014.html#016' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/014/016.html' target='xr'>14:16</a>-17] Here the Son prays to the Father for the Comforter, the Spirit. That there are three mentioned is too evident to need proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Another clear testimony to the truth that there are three distinct persons in the divine essence, is found in the form of Christian baptism, which Christ gave to his apostles, in the commission which he gave them just before his ascension to heaven. "Go," said he, "teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." [<a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/Matt/028.html#019' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/028/019.html' target='xr'>28:19</a>] These are among the most solemn and important words in the New Testament; they contain the commission under which not only the apostles, but all ministers of the gospel act, and the form of words directed to be used in baptism, was intended to be employed in the administration of this ordinance, through all periods of the church. All persons who have ever been regularly baptized, have had these words pronounced over them, while emblematically, or <a name='g10110' href='../../../rf/gl/s.html#sacramentally' target='gl'>sacramentally</a> washed from their sins. Into whose name then have all Christians, from the beginning, been baptized? Into the name of the Father,</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='41'>41</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Undoubtedly Christians are baptized into the name of God; but God is here represented as three. It would indeed be incredible that baptism should be in the name of the Supreme God, of a man or mere creature, and of a divine attribute. The mention of such an interpretation is enough to refute it. Undoubtedly our Lord, in his commission, must have intended by Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to designate three persons. Whether they are all to be considered as partaking of the divine nature, is not now the immediate object of inquiry, but whether three persons are designated. The divinity of each will be hereafter proved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Again, the <a name='g10120' href='../../../rf/gl/a.html#apostolical' target='gl'>apostolical</a> benediction, recorded in <a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/2Cor/013.html#014' target='kj'>2 Cor</a> <a href='../../../xr/2Cor/013/014.html' target='xr'>13:14</a>, is another conclusive evidence of the existence of three persons in the Godhead. "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen." Here grace is implored of the Son, love from God the Father, and communion from the Holy Ghost. It is impossible, by any proper rules of interpretation, to evade the conclusion, that three divine persons are here named. Similar proof we have in <a name='s10070' href='../../../kj/Eph/002.html#018' target='kj'>Eph</a> <a href='../../../xr/Eph/002/018.html' target='xr'>2:18</a>. "For through him (Christ) we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father." Here the same three persons are brought into view, and designated by their appropriate <a name='g10130' href='../../../rf/gl/a.html#appellatives' target='gl'>appellatives</a>. Another passage in which the three persons are distinctly mentioned together, is, <a name='s10080' href='../../../kj/1Pet/001.html#002' target='kj'>1 Pet</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Pet/001/002.html' target='xr'>1:2</a>. "Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ." Here, again, we find the same three persons clearly distinguished.</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='42'>42</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">And although the text in <a name='s10090' href='../../../kj/1John/005.html#007' target='kj'>1 John</a> <a href='../../../xr/1John/005/007.html' target='xr'>5:7</a>, has been disputed, on plausible grounds, and the testimony of existing manuscripts is <a name='g10140' href='../../../rf/gl/u.html#unfavourable' target='gl'>unfavourable</a> to its authenticity, yet there being positive evidence that ancient manuscripts which contained it, have been destroyed or lost, I think it should not be omitted in a summary of the evidence of the doctrine of the Trinity, as I have a strong persuasion that it is really a precious part of inspired Scripture, which we are not at liberty to abandon, but which was probably insidiously dropped out of the copies, in the days of <a name='g10150' href='../../../rf/gl/a.html#arian' target='gl'>Arian</a> <a name='g10160' href='../../../rf/gl/a.html#ascendency' target='gl'>ascendency</a>. What confirms me in this opinion is, that it is evidently referred to both by Tertullian and Cyprian, who lived long before our oldest extant manuscripts were written. The words are, "There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one." Here we have our whole doctrine expressed, as clearly as it could be done in words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The evidence of three distinct persons has now, we think, been established beyond all reasonable contradiction, as the doctrine clearly and repeatedly inculcated in the Scriptures of truth.</p>
