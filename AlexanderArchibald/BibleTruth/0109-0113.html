<p align="center" style="text-align:center" class="msonormal"><span style="letter-spacing:1.0pt">THE EXPIATORY SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST; OR, THE ATONEMENT</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">An atonement is that which expiates sin; which reconciles an offended party; which makes satisfaction for offences committed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The reason why an atonement was necessary, was the inflexible nature of divine justice. This attribute leads the Ruler of the universe to render to every one his due; to treat every one according to his character. The justice of God was manifested in giving to man a righteous law, and annexing a penalty exactly proportioned to the demerit of every transgression. Such a penalty being annexed to the law, it is evident that to execute it is a righteous thing; and when this penalty is incurred by transgression, the Judge of all the earth, acting justly, must inflict it. He cannot deny himself. "He is not a man that he should lie, or the son of man that he should repent." [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/Num/023.html#019' target='kj'>Num</a> <a href='../../../xr/Num/023/019.html' target='xr'>23:19</a>] If the penalty of the law might be set aside in one instance, it might in all, and then government would be at an end. Indeed, no reason can be assigned for a difference; if one sinner is exempted from punishment, the same treatment should be extended to all; for, in the administration of law and justice, there should be uniformity; though that principle does not apply to the dispensation of grace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">How then can any sinner be saved? This is a problem, which we are persuaded no finite intelligence</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='110'>110</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">could have solved. But, what created wisdom could not discover, the wisdom of the Triune God was able to accomplish. The principle of an adequate atonement by a qualified Surety, was the one adopted. But who is sufficient to make the requisite satisfaction to law and justice? for, upon the principles already stated, such a satisfaction was necessary. No mere creature could be the substitute; for, beside, that such an one would owe obedience for himself to the full extent of his powers, the actions and sufferings of a mere creature could not possess that merit which could be accepted, to answer the demands of the law against millions. Neither could any person of the Godhead perform the work of redemption. The Deity can neither suffer nor obey. This mighty difficulty can only be overcome by the constitution of a <i>person</i>, in whom both natures shall be united; that is, by the second person in the glorious Trinity assuming human nature into such intimate union with himself, that the actions and sufferings of this nature shall be the actions and sufferings of the person of the Son of God. That such a substitution was admissible depended on the wisdom and will of God. Among men, there would exist strong reasons against permitting the innocent to die for the guilty; but when we inquire what these reasons are, we find, that not one of them applies to the redemption of Christ. He has a complete right to dispose of himself, and the power to qualify himself for the arduous work; and by admitting the substitution of Christ in the room of his chosen people, no injury is sustained in any quarter; for, though the Redeemer must endure an inconceivable weight of sorrow for a season, for this he will reap a glorious and endless reward. And though the guilty escape, yet the plan provides</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">for their complete reformation; and the mercy of God is illustriously displayed, and placed in a light in which it never could have been, if this plan had not been revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">And not only is mercy and condescension exhibited in a bright and peculiar light, which gives to all the intelligent creation new discoveries of the divine character; but justice, which would have appeared glorious in the punishment of the guilty in exact proportion to their demerit, yet shines forth with a far brighter <a href='../../../rf/gl/l.html#lustre' target='gl'>lustre</a> in the sufferings of the only begotten Son of God, than in the condign punishment of a world of guilty sinners. Here, then, we see what the nature of an atonement must be. It must remove those obstacles which stood in the way of the sinner's salvation. These arose from the law and justice of God, which demanded the life of the transgressor. The Redeemer, therefore, must make a full satisfaction to law and justice, or the sinner cannot be saved. He must render a meritorious obedience to the law which men had broken, and receive the punishment of their sins in his own person. The sufferings of Christ were, therefore, of a strictly vicarious nature. "He bare our sins in his own body, on the tree." [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/1Pet/002.html#024' target='kj'>1 Pet</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Pet/002/024.html' target='xr'>2:24</a>] "He died, the just for the unjust, to bring us to God." [<a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/1Pet/003.html#018' target='kj'>1 Pet</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Pet/003/018.html' target='xr'>3:18</a>] "He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities." [<a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/Isa/053.html#005' target='kj'>Isa</a> <a href='../../../xr/Isa/053/005.html' target='xr'>53:5</a>] "Our iniquities were laid upon him." [<a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/Isa/053.html#006' target='kj'>Isa</a> <a href='../../../xr/Isa/053/006.html' target='xr'>53:6</a>] No doubt he set us a glorious example of perfect patience and fortitude, in enduring so much pain and ignominy; but example was not the main end of these sufferings, which would place them on the same level with those of other martyrs. And, it is not disputed that the death of Christ is calculated to produce a moral impression on all intelligent minds, but even this was not the</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">direct end of Christ's sufferings, according to the Scriptures; but he died as an expiatory victim, a sacrifice to satisfy divine justice, as atonement for all the sins of his chosen, as a ransom to redeem them from their bondage; yea, as a curse, to redeem them that were under the curse. And this view of the atonement is vital to the Christian system. It is plainly the doctrine of the Old as well as the New Testament; and it ever has been the doctrine of every sound part of the Christian church; and it would be easy to show, that the objections to it are either frivolous, or they are such as subvert the gospel of Christ, and bring in another gospel, which exposes the abettors of it to the anathema of Paul. <a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/Gal/001.html#008' target='kj'>Gal</a> <a href='../../../xr/Gal/001/008.html' target='xr'>1:8</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">All the sufferings of Christ should be considered as expiatory, and as constituting the atonement which he undertook to make for his people; and, indeed, his whole state of humiliation, should be considered as belonging to his expiation. When he first felt the pangs incident to infancy, when he went about from day to day, "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief," [<a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/Isa/053.html#003' target='kj'>Isa</a> <a href='../../../xr/Isa/053/003.html' target='xr'>53:3</a>]등hen reproached, slandered, and reviled등hen hungry, thirsty, and weary등hen filled with grief at the hardness and perverseness of the people, which drew tears from his eyes등hen bathed in his own blood in Gethsemane등hen betrayed, bound, dragged to trial등hen falsely accused, and condemned등hen mocked and reviled등hen scourged등hen crowned with thorns등hen fainting under the cross등hen nailed to the tree등hen exposed to the profane gaze of the multitude denuded of his garments등hen exhausted with pain and thirst드nd above all, when forsaken of God드nd when he breathed out his soul in death, he was enduring the penalty of the law. And after he was taken from</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='113'>113</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">the cross and laid in the sepulchre, though he suffered no positive pain, yet he was still bearing the curse or penalty of the law, which was death. And if it be asked for whom did the Redeemer bear all this, he has given the answer, "I lay down my life for the sheep." [<a name='s10070' href='../../../kj/John/010.html#015' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/010/015.html' target='xr'>10:15</a>] He loved his church and gave himself for it. But his atonement, considered in its intrinsic value and suitableness, is infinite, and sufficient if applied, to save the whole world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The sufferings of Christ, being those of a divine person, have an infinite value; it follows, therefore, that although the punishment of the sinner was everlasting, yet Christ could exhaust the penalty of the law in a limited time; that is, his sufferings and death, though limited to a short period, were more than an equivalent for the eternal sufferings of those for whom he laid down his life. And in making this vicarious atonement, it was not at all necessary that the Mediator should be the subject of remorse and despair; for these are not essential to the penalty of the law, but merely incidental, arising from the circumstances and moral character of the sufferer. But it was necessary that our substitute should suffer a painful and accursed death, for this was specifically threatened. Some have supposed that Christ endured something of the torments of the damned after his death, as the creed says, "he descended into hell;" but the word <i>hell</i> here signifies no more than the place of departed spirits, or the grave. Christ's sufferings were finished on the cross; and on that very day his spirit entered into paradise. <a name='s10080' href='../../../kj/Luke/023.html#043' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/023/043.html' target='xr'>23:43</a>. It cannot be reasonably doubted, but that all those for whom Christ offered himself a sacrifice, will eventually be saved.</p>
