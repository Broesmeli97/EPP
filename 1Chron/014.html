<a name='001' href='../../xr/1Chron/014/001.html' target='xr'>1.</a> Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.<br>
<a name='002' href='../../xr/1Chron/014/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1Chron/014/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1Chron/014/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> Now these <i>are</i> the names of <i>his</i> children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1Chron/014/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,<br>

<a name='007' href='../../xr/1Chron/014/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1Chron/014/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard <i>of it</i>, and went out against them.<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1Chron/014/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1Chron/014/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1Chron/014/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1Chron/014/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.<br>

<a name='014' href='../../xr/1Chron/014/014.html' target='xr'>14.</a> Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.<br>

<a name='016' href='../../xr/1Chron/014/016.html' target='xr'>16.</a> David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.<br>
