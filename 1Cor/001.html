<a name='001' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/001.html' target='xr'>1.</a> Paul, called <i>to be</i> an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes <i>our</i> brother,<br>
<a name='002' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called <i>to be</i> saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> Grace <i>be</i> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <i>from</i> the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and <i>in</i> all knowledge;<br>
<a name='006' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/006.html' target='xr'>6.</a> Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:<br>
<a name='007' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> Who shall also confirm you unto the end, <i>that ye may be</i> blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> God <i>is</i> faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and <i>that</i> there be no divisions among you; but <i>that</i> ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them <i>which are of the house</i> of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.<br>
<a name='013' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/013.html' target='xr'>13.</a> Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?<br>
<a name='014' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/014.html' target='xr'>14.</a> I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;<br>
<a name='015' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/015.html' target='xr'>15.</a> Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.<br>
<a name='016' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/016.html' target='xr'>16.</a> And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.<br>
<a name='017' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/017.html' target='xr'>17.</a> For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.<br>
<a name='018' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/018.html' target='xr'>18.</a> For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.<br>
<a name='019' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/019.html' target='xr'>19.</a> For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.<br>
<a name='020' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/020.html' target='xr'>20.</a> Where <i>is</i> the wise? where <i>is</i> the scribe? where <i>is</i> the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?<br>
<a name='021' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/021.html' target='xr'>21.</a> For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.<br>
<a name='022' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/022.html' target='xr'>22.</a> For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:<br>
<a name='023' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/023.html' target='xr'>23.</a> But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;<br>
<a name='024' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/024.html' target='xr'>24.</a> But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.<br>
<a name='025' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/025.html' target='xr'>25.</a> Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.<br>
<a name='026' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/026.html' target='xr'>26.</a> For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, <i>are called</i>:<br>
<a name='027' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/027.html' target='xr'>27.</a> But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;<br>
<a name='028' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/028.html' target='xr'>28.</a> And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, <i>yea</i>, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:<br>
<a name='029' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/029.html' target='xr'>29.</a> That no flesh should glory in his presence.<br>
<a name='030' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/030.html' target='xr'>30.</a> But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:<br>
<a name='031' href='../../xr/1Cor/001/031.html' target='xr'>31.</a> That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.<br>
