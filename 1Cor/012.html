<a name='001' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/001.html' target='xr'>1.</a> Now concerning spiritual <i>gifts</i>, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.<br>
<a name='002' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and <i>that</i> no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.<br>
<a name='006' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/006.html' target='xr'>6.</a> And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.<br>
<a name='007' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another <i>divers</i> kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also <i>is</i> Christ.<br>
<a name='013' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/013.html' target='xr'>13.</a> For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether <i>we be</i> Jews or Gentiles, whether <i>we be</i> bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.<br>
<a name='014' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/014.html' target='xr'>14.</a> For the body is not one member, but many.<br>
<a name='015' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/015.html' target='xr'>15.</a> If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?<br>
<a name='016' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/016.html' target='xr'>16.</a> And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?<br>
<a name='017' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/017.html' target='xr'>17.</a> If the whole body <i>were</i> an eye, where <i>were</i> the hearing? If the whole <i>were</i> hearing, where <i>were</i> the smelling?<br>
<a name='018' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/018.html' target='xr'>18.</a> But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.<br>
<a name='019' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/019.html' target='xr'>19.</a> And if they were all one member, where <i>were</i> the body?<br>
<a name='020' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/020.html' target='xr'>20.</a> But now <i>are they</i> many members, yet but one body.<br>
<a name='021' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/021.html' target='xr'>21.</a> And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.<br>
<a name='022' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/022.html' target='xr'>22.</a> Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:<br>
<a name='023' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/023.html' target='xr'>23.</a> And those <i>members</i> of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely <i>parts</i> have more abundant comeliness.<br>
<a name='024' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/024.html' target='xr'>24.</a> For our comely <i>parts</i> have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that <i>part</i> which lacked:<br>
<a name='025' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/025.html' target='xr'>25.</a> That there should be no schism in the body; but <i>that</i> the members should have the same care one for another.<br>
<a name='026' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/026.html' target='xr'>26.</a> And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.<br>
<a name='027' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/027.html' target='xr'>27.</a> Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.<br>
<a name='028' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/028.html' target='xr'>28.</a> And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.<br>
<a name='029' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/029.html' target='xr'>29.</a> <i>Are</i> all apostles? <i>are</i> all prophets? <i>are</i> all teachers? <i>are</i> all workers of miracles?<br>
<a name='030' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/030.html' target='xr'>30.</a> Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?<br>
<a name='031' href='../../xr/1Cor/012/031.html' target='xr'>31.</a> But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.<br>
