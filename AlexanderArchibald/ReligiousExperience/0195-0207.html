<p align="center" style="text-align:center" class="msonormal"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt;letter-spacing:1.0pt">Deathbed exercises of Andrew Rivet</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I propose now to give a summary view of the recorded experiences of several eminent persons on their deathbed; and as comparisons among the living are odious, so also among the dead. I will endeavour to act the part of an impartial and faithful narrator, but having given my analysis I will leave my readers to judge respecting the genuineness of the devotion of the persons whose exercises shall be introduced. Our accounts of the death-scenes of the apostles are too brief to enable us to say much about them; but judging from their epistles we may conclude that they met death not only with firmness but with joy. Not one of them ever expresses the least fear of death. On the contrary, Paul speaks with exultation of the prospect before him; for he exclaims, "I am now ready to be offered up and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which God, the righteous Judge, will give me at that day, and not to me only but to all who love his appearing." [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/2Tim/004.html#006' target='kj'>2 Tim</a> <a href='../../../xr/2Tim/004/006.html' target='xr'>4:6</a>-8] And Peter, who knew that he was to go out of the world by a violent death as Christ had showed him, yet seems to be no how troubled about it, but when old, speaks of it with the utmost composure. "Yea, I think it meet," says he, "as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance; knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me." [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/2Pet/001.html#013' target='kj'>2 Pet</a> <a href='../../../xr/2Pet/001/013.html' target='xr'>1:13</a>-14] No doubt John, the beloved disciple, sweetly fell asleep, with "love" upon his lips and in his heart. His whole soul seems to have been dissolved into love, and to such a man death could have no terrors. His brother James, who was slain by the sword of Herod, is the only one of the apostles of whose death we have an account in the sacred Word; except the awful account of the suicide of the traitor. Of the circumstances of the death of James, who seems to have been one of the most distinguished, and who always,</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='196'>196</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">when a selection was made to witness any particular scene, was one of them, the historian, with characteristic brevity, says, "Now about that time, Herod the king, stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church. <i>And he killed James, the brother of John, with the sword</i>." [<a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/Acts/012.html#001' target='kj'>Acts</a> <a href='../../../xr/Acts/012/001.html' target='xr'>12:1</a>-2] From this we may learn that, in order to go safely to heaven, it is not necessary that we should have a laudatory obituary on earth. I have often been shocked with the thought, that while a man's eulogy is pronounced upon earth, the poor soul may be writhing and blaspheming in the torments of hell!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Among the members of the primitive Church, Stephen was the first martyr, and his death was듈 will not say heroic, for heroes know nothing of Christ or heaven득ut I will say it was <i>Christian</i>, which is a much better style of dying than any of the heathen heroes or heroines knew anything about. He was well prepared, for he had just before been favoured with a direct view into heaven, and saw Christ on the right hand of God. No wounds on the body would be felt by one absorbed in such a heavenly vision. O how little can they harm us, who can do no more than kill the body! They rushed upon the man, hurried him to the place of execution, stoned him, "calling on [God] and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. And he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep." [<a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/Acts/007.html#059' target='kj'>Acts</a> <a href='../../../xr/Acts/007/059.html' target='xr'>7:59</a>-60] There was nothing wanting here to render this a glorious death. And as he is called the proto-martyr, so his death was a prototype of the deaths of succeeding martyrs. The accounts given of the joys and triumphs of some of them approximate to miracle; but we know not how insensible to bodily pain the soul may be rendered, which is overflowing with the love of Christ. This is the true secret of their ambition to be crucified or burnt or cast to the wild beasts. But as these martyrs seem to have been another race of men from us, and lived in times very different from ours, let us come down and contemplate the dying Christian in circumstances similar to our own, and see what grace can do in these latter days. And I propose to select the experiences of men of different countries. The accounts which I shall bring forward are not new: to some of my readers they may all be familiar; but as the men were eminent in the church and distinguished for talents, their biographies, being commonly known, will answer the end in view better than</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='197'>197</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">the deathbed exercises of unknown persons, of whose lives we could have no satisfactory information.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The first person of whose dying exercises I propose to give a condensed narrative is Andrew Rivet, 1573-1651, a Frenchman by birth and education, but who spent the greater part of his life in Holland, where, at Leyden, he was professor of theology. The learned need not be informed, that in that age when theology was more thoroughly studied than in any other since the apostles' days, Andrew Rivet had no superior, whether you contemplate him as an exegetical or polemical theologian. His acquaintance with the Christian fathers was most exact and extensive; and he knew how to estimate their <a href='../../../rf/gl/l.html#labours' target='gl'>labours</a>, and what deference was due to their authority, of which he gave full evidence in the work entitled <i>Critici Sacri</i>, which is now the best guide on this subject which the young theologian can follow. Rivet's theology was as sound as it was extensive. His great learning did not turn his head or lead him into heresy; but it will be seen by the following narrative how little value he set on all his learning, compared with the teaching of the divine Spirit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Having preached a sermon on Christmas day, 1650, he was immediately afterwards taken ill with a constipation of the bowels. Of a beloved niece who attended on him, he asked what she thought of his disease, which he thought would prove mortal. She answered that she was of the same opinion, but that he had nothing to fear, having been long prepared to follow God when He should call드nd that his life had already been long, and nothing remained to be desired, but that it should be crowned with a happy and glorious end! "Thou speakest right," said he, "and I pray thee always address thyself to me with like speeches, and while my sickness continues, depart not from me day nor night. Promise me now that thou wilt keep a cheerful countenance, and that thou wilt speak nothing to me, but what may administer joy and support to me. Although I fear not death, yet I fear the trial of those pains which I have always had a very sharp feeling of." Then, suddenly turning his speech unto God, he said, "Great God, Thou art my Father; Thou hast given me both life and a new life; Thou hast taught me from my youth, and I have declared Thy wonderful works; forsake me not now in my old age. Hitherto, through Thy peculiar favour, Thou hast preserved me sound in my body and my faculties, and the</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='198'>198</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">functions of my mind have not been impaired, so that a little before I was oppressed by this disease I found myself as apt and ready for the exercise of my vocation as in my flourishing youth. O Lord God! if it be Thy will that I should longer attend upon Thy service, Thou canst assuage my disease in one moment; but if Thou hast decreed otherwise, <i>Thy will be done</i>. This one thing I beg with most inward affections, that Thou wilt make me conformable to Thy good will듧et not Thy good Spirit depart from me, that in this conflict Thy strength may make me a conqueror. Accomplish this, O Lord, for Thine own sake, and since Thou hast employed me in Thy work, grant that I may die an <a href='../../../rf/gl/h.html#honourable' target='gl'>honourable</a> death, and such as may be an example unto others: that I may stand fast in that sound doctrine which I have taught, and may make a good confession thereof before witnesses, that thereby Thy church may be both instructed and edified. Let me apply to myself by a lively faith all the promises of the Gospel, and let them put forth their efficacy in me, unto my joy and eternal consolation, that nothing in the world, neither affliction nor distress, may separate me from Thee, or cause me to doubt of Thy love and favour. Thou knowest my weakness and infirmities: permit not the grievousness of my pain to cast me into impatience or murmuring. Either make my pains tolerable, or furnish me with fortitude and constancy sufficient to bear them. That I may not offend with my tongue, keep Thou the door of my lips!"</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The pains of his disease were very great, but he continued to call upon God for help and for support. His expressions of his own sinfulness and weakness were of the most abasing kind. Confessing himself to be a miserable sinner, and casting away all confidence in any good thing which he had done in his life, he accused his own defects, and ascribed unto God all the good which he had ever done, often repeating such expressions as these: "It is God that hath wrought the work for me; shall I allege or plead my own righteousness before Him? Far be that from me. If I should justify myself, my own mouth would condemn me. I will rather open my sin before Him in a most humble confession of it, and pray that He will increase in me the grace of true repentance; yea, let Him wear out this body with sorrow, it matters not, so He give to me a broken and a contrite spirit, which is a sacrifice acceptable unto Himself. As for my part, I do most willingly offer up myself. Accept, O Lord, this imperfect</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">sacrifice, and supply the defects thereof by the perfect righteousness of that great High Priest, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered Himself unto God without spot. Let me be accepted as a living sacrifice, holy, and well pleasing unto God, which is our reasonable service. Crucify, O Lord, this old man, that the body of sin may be utterly destroyed, and that I may rise to newness of life. <i>The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord</i>." [<a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/Rom/006.html#023' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/006/023.html' target='xr'>6:23</a>] He repeated the word <i>gift</i>, and added, "it is mere grace, not of works, but of Him that calleth". [<a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/Rom/009.html#011' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/009/011.html' target='xr'>9:11</a>] "<i>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died; yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us</i>." [<a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/Rom/008.html#033' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/008/033.html' target='xr'>8:33</a>-34]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">After a short sleep he proceeded in the following strain: "I am God's, and He will save me. He hath honoured me with a holy calling, and hath not suffered His gift to be altogether useless in me, as to the edification of His church. As to myself, I can most truly affirm that I have not served Him for filthy lucre, but with a sincere heart; and that I myself was first persuaded of the truth of the Gospel before I preached it to others. I tasted the good Word of God, which, by its power, pierceth to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and is a <a name='g10020' href='../../../rf/gl/d.html#discerner' target='gl'>discerner</a> of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Thou hast known my heart, O eternal God! Thou knowest that I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, but have esteemed it my only honour to serve Thee; and that I have delighted myself in the pleasure of obeying Thy will. Such was Thy goodness to me. I truly and humbly acknowledge that whatsoever good thing was in me flowed from Thy grace; but my defects ought to be ascribed to my inbred corruption. Alas! I acknowledge this with humble and serious repentance. How often have I sinned in so holy a charge, not only by omitting many things which I ought to have done, but also by doing many things amiss! Long since had I been cast off, were it not that I had to do with so good a Lord, who hath borne with me, and hath been so gracious to me as not to exact a severe account of my words and works. Alas! O Lord my God! enter not into judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified. Let me be found, not having my own righteousness, but the righteousness of Thy Son; for the sake of whom I beg Thy favour. Pardon, O my God! pardon the iniquity of Thy</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">servant, who is devoted to Thy fear. I refuse not Thy discipline듈 know it is necessary. Only this I earnestly beg, that it may turn to my salvation. 'Chasten me, O Lord, but in measure, lest thou bring me to nothing.' [<i>cf</i>. <a name='s10070' href='../../../kj/Jer/010.html#024' target='kj'>Jer</a> <a href='../../../xr/Jer/010/024.html' target='xr'>10:24</a>] Let not my trial exceed my strength, lest I sin through impatience, and become a scandal to those I should edify." He uttered many similar expressions for which we have not room.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">To Renessius, a doctor of divinity who came to see him, he said, "I pray you testify unto all men, that I die in the faith and the doctrine which I have always delivered, both in preaching and writing; and if in some things I have erred, I pray God, that He will make perfect all my imperfections."</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">He received the visits of all who expressed a desire to see him, and would have none hindered from coming to him. "Let all that will," said he, "have access to visit me. I ought to give an example of dying to other men." And to those who stood around his bed, he said, "Come, see a man, who is an example of the great mercy of God. What shall I render unto Him? All His benefits overwhelm me. He hath so disposed my life, that in my whole course, I have had a healthy body. He hath heaped upon me both temporal and spiritual blessings; and now, before I am rendered feeble or morose through old age, He comes unto me to make provision for me. He has both called me, and made me willing to follow at His call. And now, when the end of my life is within my view, He still affords me the perfect use of reason, that I may praise my God in the land of the living, and instruct my neighbours by my example. Pray for me, my friends, that this grace may be continued unto me, until I draw my last breath; that He will strengthen my faith, confirm my patience, and raise my hope. He hath already captivated all my affections to his will. I have cast the care of me, of mine, of life, and all my affairs, upon Him. Let Him do with my body as it pleaseth Him, so it may but be well with my soul. ... And now there is nothing I am concerned about, neither is my life dear unto me, so that I may finish my course with joy, and <a href='../../../rf/gl/f.html#fulfil' target='gl'>fulfil</a> the ministry which I have received of the Lord; which is best done at the last."</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">He would not permit any clergyman who came to see him, to go away without praying with him. It grieved him much that his wife, who was of feeble health, should be subjected to so much fatigue and watchfulness in attending on him. But as she was</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='201'>201</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">unwilling to leave him, he said, "Since thou wilt have it so, tarry; it is a pleasure to me to see thee. The Lord strengthen thee!" Friday night was spent in grievous pains, and in most ardent prayers for the church of God, for the princes who were defenders of it, for the people that lived under their jurisdiction, and for the pastors to whom the care of souls was committed. He seemed to be greatly interested in behalf of the United Provinces of Holland. "O God," said he, "withdraw not Thy protection from these Provinces; neither remove Thy candlestick away. Let not Thine anger burn against them, because of that impiety and <a name='g10040' href='../../../rf/gl/p.html#profaneness' target='gl'>profaneness</a> which hath made too great a progress. Rather bow their hearts unto repentance, and convert them, that Thy judgments may be prevented. Let them coalesce in one body; especially let them be joined unto Thee, without whom all union is but conspiracy. Preside in their Assembly, and bend their hearts, so that all their decrees may lean to the good of the Commonwealth, and especially of the church."</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Rivet's sufferings were exceedingly great, but he bore them with wonderful patience, and whenever there was the least interval of ease, he was engaged in prayer or exhortation. On the last day of December, after having endured indescribable agonies from the disease and from the remedies made use of, he offered up the following fervent prayer for the church: "O Lord, it is Thy possession, which Thou hast purchased with Thine own blood. Forsake not Thine own work듧et a holy jealousy be kindled in Thee. Lift up on high the arms of Thy power, and bring down the audacious ones, which tyrannize over Thy flock. Rebuke Thou the negligent that heal her wounds slightly. Turn to the right way those that wander, and strengthen those ready to fall through division. Gather both the one and the other to Thyself into one body, building them up upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner stone, in whom all the building <a href='../../../rf/gl/f.html#fitly' target='gl'>fitly</a> framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord." And then, making a little pause, he said, "I have been one of those builders; I have brought what I received from the Lord that I might put to my helping hand, with others, towards the building of the temple; and I myself shall be a living stone in the house."</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">On the first day of the year 1651, which was the Lord's day, upon opening his eyes he said, "O Lord, Thou hast granted me</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='202'>202</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">to see the beginning of the year. Thou hast measured out my time until the middle of this age." Having sent to The Hague for his son, he inquired respecting the weather, and being informed that the cold was sharp and severe, he prayed thus, "O my God, bring my son unto me, that I may see him, embrace him, and bless him, before I die." Then turning to his wife he said, "Dost thou think that this earnest desire to see my son proceeds from mere natural affection? Nothing less. Truly I love no man any more according to the flesh. I earnestly desire his eternal salvation, and I hope to have such discourses with him as will increase his zeal in adorning his spiritual vocation." (His son was a minister.) "I have yet spirit and utterance sufficient for this work. Let none be hindered from coming to me. It is usual for a man in my station, by admonishing others, publicly to make profession of his own faith. Not for the sake of a little vainglory, O Lord, Thou knowest; for it little concerns me to be approved unto men, provided I may approve myself unto God. But I desire the salvation of many, and to give testimony to the truth of those things which I have publicly taught."</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Some officers of the garrison having come to see him, two or three of whom were from France, he addressed them in the following manner: "I rejoice that I have an opportunity to make a confession of my faith before you that are my countrymen; and I pray you to keep it in memory, and give testimony of it where it shall be necessary. You see before you a man, weak indeed but without guile, who solemnly protests that he has never published in his writings, nor taught with his lips, anything that did not agree with the sense of his heart, and the doctrine which has been delivered to us by the prophets and apostles, which is the same with that laid down in the Confession of Faith of our churches, in which I have lived, and in which I purpose to die. The Lord God Almighty confirm you in that faith, so that nothing may move you from it. 'For what will it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?'

Learn to number your days, and get a wise heart. Look upon me, and let me be as an example unto you.

<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">When his visitors were all gone, and his own family stood around his bed, he said to his niece: "My daughter, do not depart from me, but persist with me in the duty of prayer. Do not fear to rehearse all those words to me, which God shall suggest unto thy heart or mouth. This sweet and pleasing communication shall help to pass over the night with the more ease. And God will be with us and assist our good intentions. He will help our weaknesses and afford us matter of supplications and <a name='g10060' href='../../../rf/gl/t.html#thanksgivings' target='gl'>thanksgivings</a>. Such discourses are pleasing unto Him. He attends unto them that fear Him, when they talk together of those things that belong to the salvation of their souls." And then, as one in rapture, he exclaimed: "My God, Thou hast drawn me and I was drawn. Thou hast known me from my mother's womb with a merciful and efficacious knowledge. Thou hast called me by name. Thou hast bored mine ears, and I was attentive. I have declared Thy message in the congregation, and Thy word was sweeter than honey in my mouth. Who am I, O God, but dust and ashes, an earthen and a frail vessel, into which, notwithstanding, Thou hast been pleased to pour a holy liquor, and seed of immortality. Thou livest and Thou makest me to live. I shall not die, but live for ever, with that 'life which is hid with Christ in God.'

Behold I am dead, and also raised from the dead. I live, not in myself, but in the life of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me. Thou hast chosen me before Thou gavest me a being. And it pleased Thee that I should be born of believing parents, and especially of a mother eminent in holiness, who dedicated me to Thy service from my tender years. With what care and affection did she implant the seeds of piety in me! And the Almighty God, who worketh in all, gave His blessing to this diligent nurture, and heard her ardent prayers; and my ministry has been accepted of Him. I am Thy servant; O my God, Thou hast taught me from my youth; and I have taught Thy wonderful works, and Thy grace unto this day; for Thy gifts have not been without fruit in me.

<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Andrew Rivet had a brother in the ministry nearly as eminent as himself, whom he loved with a very sincere and tender affection. The niece who now attended on him was the daughter of this brother, and that he might know the gracious dealings of God towards him in his sickness, he requested his niece to write down whatever he might say, from time to time, and communicate it to her father. "Not," says he, "that I would procure praise to myself, but I would have it known to all, that the religion which I have professed and taught in the name of God is the true religion, and that alone which leads men unto salvation; and, particularly, I would have my brother informed of that inestimable grace which I have received of God, that he may be abundantly comforted and strengthened in his expectation of a better life, which I already enjoy. O! with how great love have I loved and esteemed him! Yea, I have loved the gifts of God in him, and shall love them to the last. I pray God, who is the giver of every good gift, that He will strengthen and make perfect His own work in him. O Lord God, I pray not only for my brother, but for all those in France to whom Thou hast committed the conduct and rule of the churches. Bless their persons, sanctify their gifts, grant that they may return to the simplicity which is in Christ, and that they detract not from the glory of God, to ascribe unto man what belongs to his salvation." He now broke out in an extraordinary transport: "O great and immense mercy! who can but be rapt into admiration? He gives both being and</span></p>

But not satisfied with sending messages to his brother, on the second day of January he requested to be raised up and placed in a chair, that he might write to him; and accordingly, he penned with his own hand a farewell letter, full of solemnity and tenderness. He wrote also to his nephew, after which exertion he found himself much exhausted. But the only thing which gave him any uneasiness of mind was, lest he should be disappointed in seeing his son.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">But his comforts were not uninterrupted. After his regular physicians had given him up, some persons who had known relief in such cases from a particular remedy, urged that it should be tried. He submitted, but while the experiment put him to great pain, it produced no change for the better; and when it was over, his mind appeared to be perturbed and uncomfortable. "Alas!" said he, "He is departed from me, that made glad my heart. I have grieved that Holy Spirit, the Comforter, who had filled my soul with peace and joy. I have been so wretched and unhappy as to give ear to those who spoke to me of my returning to the world. I have been tickled with the desire of living, and how could such a thing be, after the fruits of the heavenly Canaan have been tasted?" Here he appeared much distressed, and casting his arms about the neck of his beloved niece, exclaimed, "My dear niece, help me; continue to discourse of good things to me. Call upon the Comforter to return and renew that excellent work which He had begun in me. O, return! return! confirm me with Thy strength before I go hence and be seen no more." He remained in this state of distress for a short time등hen he was reminded of the precious promises of God; but being exhausted, he fell into a swoon. When he opened his eyes, he said to his wife who was by him: "My dearest yokefellow, we have lived together in peace for thirty years, and I thank thee for thy help, which hath been a great comfort unto me, for I did cast all domestic cares on thee; continue, I beseech thee, to love my children with that pious affection which thou hast shown hitherto" (the children were by a former wife). Then turning to his son, who had arrived that morning, he said: "And thou my son, love and honour this dearest companion of my life, the partner of all my joys and my</span></p>

Then taking hold of both their hands and joining them together, he said: "Promise that you will maintain a holy and mutual friendship with each other," to which they gave their assent. Then turning to his wife, he said "The Lord bless thee, my dear love, and strengthen thee. He is a husband to the widow, and a father of the fatherless."</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">And to his son: "The Almighty Father bless thee, my son, guide thee in all thy ways, enrich thee with all Christian virtues, and plentifully make thee to abound in all spiritual and temporal blessings! Regard not the world, nor its deceitful hopes, for the world passeth away, and the lust thereof. Place all thy felicity in the blessing of God. Be strong in faith, and prepared unto every good work. Let the peace of God dwell in thee, and make thee peaceable and kind." And to his niece he said: "Farewell, my dear niece, we have a kindred in the heavens, which shall endure for ever."</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">After many other discourses, similar to those recorded, he again collected his family and blessed them, and desired all to retire and leave him alone. His niece, who scarcely ever went out of his sight, asked if he wished her to withdraw also. He said "Do not go from me, but be thou a witness of my last hours." After he had exhausted himself with conversation with his son, Mr. Hulsius, and others, he was asked how he did. He said "Very well듈 feel no pain듈 am filled with the grace of God듈 am not sensible of cold or heat듈 fear, no more, the inconveniences of temporal life듮he Spirit of God strengthens me, and affords me abundant consolations. I have no doubt of my salvation. He hath set me on high. He hath hid me in His hiding place. He hath fenced me round about, and hath perfected whatsoever concerns me. I am like a vessel filled with pure water which no agitation troubles. It is God that justifieth me, who shall condemn? It is Christ that died, yea rather, is risen again. ... O my God, I thank Thee that thou hast given me the spirit of humility, sincerity and truth. I have not been as a tinkling cymbal. O Lord, Thou knowest the secrets of my soul, and my inmost thoughts.

<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Though every day was expected to be his last, yet the strength of his constitution enabled him to hold out until Saturday, January 7, 1651. To the last, he continued to spend his whole time, when awake, in prayer, and in such discourses as we have recorded. On Thursday morning, when he saw the light of day, he said, "It is daylight. I shall shortly no more know the difference between day and night. I am come to the eve of that great and eternal day, and am going to that place where the sun shall no more give light. God will be an everlasting light unto me; and already, O Lord, Thou sendest the rays of that light into my soul, and openest my eyes that I may perceive them. O how powerfully dost Thou work in me! While this old man decays, Thou puttest on me the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of Him that created it. Deliver me from this prison, that I may celebrate Thy name; yet neither do I so contemn this body, as not to think of its restoration; for I know the dead shall live, yea, my dead body. It is sown in corruption, it shall be raised in <a href='../../../rf/gl/i.html#incorruption' target='gl'>incorruption</a>; it is sown a vile body, but it will rise a glorious body; it is sown in weakness, but it shall be raised again in power. In a word, it shall be conformed to the glorious body of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is become the firstfruits of them that sleep. I shall see Him in my flesh듨ine own eyes shall see Him듈 shall behold His face in righteousness, and shall be satisfied with His likeness when I awake." The whole of this day was spent in such like discourses. Among other things, he said: "The sense of divine favour increaseth in me every moment. My pains are tolerable, and my joys inestimable. I am no more vexed with earthly cares. I remember when any new book came out, how earnestly I have longed after it득ut now all that is but dust. Thou art my all, O Lord; my good is to approach unto Thee. O what a library have I in God, in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge! Thou art the teacher of spirits듈 have learned more divinity in these ten days that Thou hast come to visit me, than I did in fifty years before." The last words he attempted to utter were those of Paul: "I have fought a good fight," [<a name='s10100' href='../../../kj/2Tim/004.html#007' target='kj'>2 Tim</a> <a href='../../../xr/2Tim/004/007.html' target='xr'>4:7</a>] etc., and when others assisted him to finish them, he said, "<i>Amen</i>".</span></p>
