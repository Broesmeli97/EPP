<a name='001' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/001.html' target='xr'>1.</a> Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?<br>
<a name='002' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?<br>
<a name='006' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/006.html' target='xr'>6.</a> But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.<br>
<a name='007' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather <i>suffer yourselves to</i> be defrauded?<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that <i>your</i> brethren.<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.<br>
<a name='013' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/013.html' target='xr'>13.</a> Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body <i>is</i> not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.<br>
<a name='014' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/014.html' target='xr'>14.</a> And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.<br>
<a name='015' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/015.html' target='xr'>15.</a> Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make <i>them</i> the members of an harlot? God forbid.<br>
<a name='016' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/016.html' target='xr'>16.</a> What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.<br>
<a name='017' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/017.html' target='xr'>17.</a> But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.<br>
<a name='018' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/018.html' target='xr'>18.</a> Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.<br>
<a name='019' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/019.html' target='xr'>19.</a> What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost <i>which is</i> in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?<br>
<a name='020' href='../../xr/1Cor/006/020.html' target='xr'>20.</a> For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.<br>
