<p>
Our goal with this EPP CD is to provide Christians today with ready access to biblical writings from times past. As with all such historical writings, and especially those dealing with spiritual topics, these works will not always conform to modern social sensibilities, and some may even be thought offensive. It has been our observation that Christian men in the past were far more direct in their writing than that to which modern readers are accustomed. <br><br>

The EPP does believe, however, that these authors were faithful men of God and that their writings are of immense utility in the church today. We trust that our readers will handle any unexpected directness with charity and Christian understanding. It may also be the case that some readers find such directness to be refreshing (even amusing at times). In any event, we welcome any comments or recommendations regarding the content of EPP.<br><br>
