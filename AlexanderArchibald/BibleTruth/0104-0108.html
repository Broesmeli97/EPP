<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">Christ did not come into the world until about four thousand years from the creation had elapsed. By this delay it clearly appeared how deep was the depravity of fallen man, as all nations, the Israelites only excepted, departed from God, and lost the knowledge of his true character. And having apostatized from the worship and service of their Creator, they</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">universally, with the exception already mentioned, addicted themselves to the most abominable idolatries, and to every species of degrading vice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">This apostasy was not owing to any defect of external light, for, as Paul teaches, "that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God hath showed it unto them. For the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse. Because when they knew God they glorified him not as God, neither were they thankful; but they became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four footed beasts, and creeping things." [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/Rom/001.html#019' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/001/019.html' target='xr'>1:19</a>-23] It was proper that the world should have the opportunity of making trial of their own wisdom before the device of infinite wisdom should be manifested. Opportunity had also been thus afforded to prepare the way for the advent of the Mediator, by a system of types and prophecies, which clearly designated his person and offices, and thus furnished indubitable evidence of his being indeed the Christ of God. The time selected for the advent of the Saviour was also suitable, because the world was then full of inhabitants; the human mind had been highly cultivated, and the intellectual faculties had attained their utmost <a href='../../../rf/gl/v.html#vigour' target='gl'>vigour</a>, and all the civilized world were subject to one government; and the Latin and Greek languages were understood through the whole extent of the Roman empire. And although in the previous age civil discord and desolating wars disturbed the empire, all was now</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">reduced to peace under Augustus Caesar, so that a favourable opportunity was afforded for propagating the gospel among the nations. Besides, the time of Messiah's advent had been fixed in the distinct <a name='g10020' href='../../../rf/gl/e.html#enunciations' target='gl'>enunciations</a> of prophecy. Shiloh was to come before the <a href='../../../rf/gl/s.html#sceptre' target='gl'>sceptre</a> had entirely departed from Judah, which was now far on the wane. He was to fill the temple of Zerubbabel with his glory, which was soon after this destroyed. And the specified weeks of Daniel, when the Messiah should be cut off, were drawing to a close. The "<a href='../../../rf/gl/f.html#fulness' target='gl'>fulness</a> of time" was therefore come, when "God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law." [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/Gal/004.html#004' target='kj'>Gal</a> <a href='../../../xr/Gal/004/004.html' target='xr'>4:4</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">It had been predicted by <a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/Isa/007.html#014' target='kj'>Isa</a> <a href='../../../xr/Isa/007/014.html' target='xr'>7:14</a>, that "a virgin should conceive and bring forth a Son, and that his name should be <i>Emmanuel</i>, God with us." It was also foretold by the same prophet, that "a child should be born, who should be the <i>Mighty God</i>." There was, therefore, a general expectation among the Jews, that the advent of the Messiah was at hand; and this expectation was increased, when John the Baptist began to preach in the wilderness, saying, "the kingdom of heaven is at hand;" [<a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/Matt/003.html#002' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/003/002.html' target='xr'>3:2</a>] thus fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah; "The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God;" (<a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/Isa/040.html#003' target='kj'>Isa</a> <a href='../../../xr/Isa/040/003.html' target='xr'>40:3</a>,) and also the prediction of Malachi, "Behold, I will send my Messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me;" and again, "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord." (<a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/Mal/003.html#001' target='kj'>Mal</a> <a href='../../../xr/Mal/003/001.html' target='xr'>3:1</a>; <a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/Mal/004.html#005' target='kj'>Mal</a> <a href='../../../xr/Mal/004/005.html' target='xr'>4:5</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The place of the Messiah's birth had been explicitly named by the prophet Micah; so that when the</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, and inquired where he was to be born who was King of the Jews, Herod the king called together a convention of all the priests and scribes, to determine this question, which they appear to have agreed upon unanimously, for they immediately answered, "in Bethlehem of Judea," [<a name='s10070' href='../../../kj/Matt/002.html#006' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/002/006.html' target='xr'>2:6</a>] and referred to the prophecy of Micah. The providence of God in bringing about the <a href='../../../rf/gl/f.html#fulfilment' target='gl'>fulfilment</a> of this prophecy was remarkable, for Mary and her husband resided at Nazareth. But it had been so ordered by an imperial edict, that every person should resort to the town to which his family properly belonged, to be registered, with a view to a general taxation; and thus the mother of our Lord was brought to Bethlehem at the very time when she was to be delivered of the child, conceived in her womb by the power of the Holy Spirit. And as there was not found room for them in the inn, the Son of God was born in a stable, and laid in a manger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">This glorious event for our lost world, was not suffered to take place without suitable notice: for however inattentive the great men of this world might be to this humble, but miraculous birth, the angels of God had their attention directed to it as the most important event which had ever occurred in our world. One of the heavenly host, probably Gabriel, appeared to a company of shepherds in the vicinity, who were watching their flocks by night, and said, "Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people, for unto you is born, this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord." [<a name='s10080' href='../../../kj/Luke/002.html#010' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/002/010.html' target='xr'>2:10</a>-11] And as soon as he had delivered his message, "a multitude of the heavenly host was with the angel, praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, and good will to men." [<a name='s10090' href='../../../kj/Luke/002.html#014' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/002/014.html' target='xr'>2:14</a>]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Until Christ was about thirty years of age, he lived in retirement at Nazareth. When John, his forerunner, had been for some time engaged in his public ministry preaching repentance, and baptizing the people, Jesus came forth, and was baptized in the river Jordan. Having voluntarily placed himself under the law, it was proper that he should comply with not only the moral precepts, but with all the ceremonial institutions then in force. For although he could not attend on these institutions as one who needed forgiveness, or purification, or repentance, yet as he came to take the sinner's place, he obeyed all the laws then obligatory on the people; for in infancy, he was circumcised, when grown up, he attended the Jewish worship at the temple, partook of the passover, joined in the worship of the synagogue, and, as John was commissioned of God to preach and baptize, he submitted to his baptism. John at first forbade him, saying, "I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?" [<a name='s10100' href='../../../kj/Matt/003.html#014' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/003/014.html' target='xr'>3:14</a>] But Jesus answered, and said, "Suffer it to be so now;" [<a name='s10110' href='../../../kj/Matt/003.html#015' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/003/015.html' target='xr'>3:15</a>] and assigned as a reason, "for thus it becometh us to <a href='../../../rf/gl/f.html#fulfil' target='gl'>fulfil</a> all righteousness."</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">By the incarnation the divine and human natures were mysteriously united. "The word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." [<a name='s10120' href='../../../kj/John/001.html#014' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/001/014.html' target='xr'>1:14</a>] "God was manifest in the flesh."

[<a name='s10140' href='../../../kj/Phil/002.html#008' target='kj'>Phil</a> <a href='../../../xr/Phil/002/008.html' target='xr'>2:8</a>]</p>
