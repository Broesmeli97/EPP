<a name='001' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/001.html' target='xr'>1.</a> So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.<br>
<a name='002' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon <i>of wine</i>.<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> And he appointed <i>certain</i> of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;<br>
<a name='006' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/006.html' target='xr'>6.</a> Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.<br>
<a name='007' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> Then on that day David delivered first <i>this psalm</i> to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;<br>
<a name='013' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/013.html' target='xr'>13.</a> O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.<br>
<a name='014' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/014.html' target='xr'>14.</a> He <i>is</i> the LORD our God; his judgments <i>are</i> in all the earth.<br>
<a name='015' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/015.html' target='xr'>15.</a> Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word <i>which</i> he commanded to a thousand generations;<br>
<a name='016' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/016.html' target='xr'>16.</a> <i>Even of the covenant</i> which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;<br>
<a name='017' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/017.html' target='xr'>17.</a> And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, <i>and</i> to Israel <i>for</i> an everlasting covenant,<br>
<a name='018' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/018.html' target='xr'>18.</a> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;<br>
<a name='019' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/019.html' target='xr'>19.</a> When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.<br>
<a name='020' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/020.html' target='xr'>20.</a> And <i>when</i> they went from nation to nation, and from <i>one</i> kingdom to another people;<br>
<a name='021' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/021.html' target='xr'>21.</a> He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,<br>
<a name='022' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/022.html' target='xr'>22.</a> <i>Saying</i>, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.<br>
<a name='023' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/023.html' target='xr'>23.</a> Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.<br>
<a name='024' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/024.html' target='xr'>24.</a> Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.<br>
<a name='025' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/025.html' target='xr'>25.</a> For great <i>is</i> the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also <i>is</i> to be feared above all gods.<br>
<a name='026' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/026.html' target='xr'>26.</a> For all the gods of the people <i>are</i> idols: but the LORD made the heavens.<br>
<a name='027' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/027.html' target='xr'>27.</a> Glory and honour <i>are</i> in his presence; strength and gladness <i>are</i> in his place.<br>
<a name='028' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/028.html' target='xr'>28.</a> Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.<br>
<a name='029' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/029.html' target='xr'>29.</a> Give unto the LORD the glory <i>due</i> unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.<br>
<a name='030' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/030.html' target='xr'>30.</a> Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.<br>
<a name='031' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/031.html' target='xr'>31.</a> Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let <i>men</i> say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.<br>
<a name='032' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/032.html' target='xr'>32.</a> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that <i>is</i> therein.<br>
<a name='033' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/033.html' target='xr'>33.</a> Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.<br>
<a name='034' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/034.html' target='xr'>34.</a> O give thanks unto the LORD; for <i>he is</i> good; for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.<br>
<a name='035' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/035.html' target='xr'>35.</a> And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, <i>and</i> glory in thy praise.<br>
<a name='036' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/036.html' target='xr'>36.</a> Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.<br>
<a name='037' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/037.html' target='xr'>37.</a> So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required:<br>
<a name='038' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/038.html' target='xr'>38.</a> And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah <i>to be</i> porters:<br>
<a name='039' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/039.html' target='xr'>39.</a> And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that <i>was</i> at Gibeon,<br>
<a name='040' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/040.html' target='xr'>40.</a> To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and <i>to do</i> according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;<br>
<a name='041' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/041.html' target='xr'>41.</a> And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever;<br>
<a name='042' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/042.html' target='xr'>42.</a> And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun <i>were</i> porters.<br>
<a name='043' href='../../xr/1Chron/016/043.html' target='xr'>43.</a> And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.<br>
