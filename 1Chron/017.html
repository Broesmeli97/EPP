<a name='001' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/001.html' target='xr'>1.</a> Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD <i>remaineth</i> under curtains.<br>
<a name='002' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that <i>is</i> in thine heart; for God <i>is</i> with thee.<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from <i>one</i> tabernacle <i>to another</i>.<br>
<a name='006' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/006.html' target='xr'>6.</a> Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?<br>
<a name='007' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, <i>even</i> from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that <i>are</i> in the earth.<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> And since the time that I commanded judges <i>to be</i> over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go <i>to be</i> with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.<br>
<a name='013' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/013.html' target='xr'>13.</a> I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took <i>it</i> from <i>him</i> that was before thee:<br>
<a name='014' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/014.html' target='xr'>14.</a> But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.<br>
<a name='015' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/015.html' target='xr'>15.</a> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.<br>
<a name='016' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/016.html' target='xr'>16.</a> And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who <i>am</i> I, O LORD God, and what <i>is</i> mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?<br>
<a name='017' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/017.html' target='xr'>17.</a> And <i>yet</i> this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast <i>also</i> spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.<br>
<a name='018' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/018.html' target='xr'>18.</a> What can David <i>speak</i> more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.<br>
<a name='019' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/019.html' target='xr'>19.</a> O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all <i>these</i> great things.<br>
<a name='020' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/020.html' target='xr'>20.</a> O LORD, <i>there is</i> none like thee, neither <i>is there any</i> God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.<br>
<a name='021' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/021.html' target='xr'>21.</a> And what one nation in the earth <i>is</i> like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem <i>to be</i> his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?<br>
<a name='022' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/022.html' target='xr'>22.</a> For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.<br>
<a name='023' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/023.html' target='xr'>23.</a> Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.<br>
<a name='024' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/024.html' target='xr'>24.</a> Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> the God of Israel, <i>even</i> a God to Israel: and <i>let</i> the house of David thy servant <i>be</i> established before thee.<br>
<a name='025' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/025.html' target='xr'>25.</a> For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found <i>in his heart</i> to pray before thee.<br>
<a name='026' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/026.html' target='xr'>26.</a> And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:<br>
<a name='027' href='../../xr/1Chron/017/027.html' target='xr'>27.</a> Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and <i>it shall be</i> blessed for ever.<br>
