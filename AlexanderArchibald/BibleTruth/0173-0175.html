<p align="center" style="text-align:center" class="msonormal"><span style="letter-spacing:1.0pt">BAPTISM</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">There has always been a tendency to make too much of these external rites, and to depend unduly upon them, as a ground on which to hope for salvation. Thus, the Jews so exalted the importance of the rite of circumcision, that they seem to have thought that being descended from Abraham, and having this sign in their flesh, insured their salvation: which false confidence Christ and his apostles laboured to overthrow. It is not wonderful, therefore, that the same error should arise in regard to baptism. In the New Testament, baptism is both a duty and a privilege; but no undue importance is given to it, nor any undue efficacy ascribed to it. Paul, indeed, spent little of his time in administering this rite. He avoided it at Corinth, where there were divisions and factions, lest any should say that he baptized in his own name. And he says expressly, that Christ sent him "not to baptize but to preach the gospel;" [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/1Cor/001.html#017' target='kj'>1 Cor</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Cor/001/017.html' target='xr'>1:17</a>] which single declaration is a refutation of the opinion that internal grace, or regeneration, always accompanies baptism; for in that case, baptism was far more important than preaching. For Paul certainly could not convey grace by preaching; but if he could have regenerated all to whom he</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">administered baptism, he should have given himself up entirely to this work. These sacramental institutions are not intended to be the means of conveying grace to the subjects in some mysterious manner, but they are intended to operate on adults by the word of truth, which accompanies the ordinance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Some lay a great stress on the mode in which baptism is administered, insisting that a total immersion of the body in water is essential to the right administration. In the ceremonies of a sacrament, some things belong to its essence, because they represent symbolically the truth intended to be impressed on the mind; other things are indifferent, because they are merely incidental, and do not affect the import of the sacrament. If it could be proved that the act of immersion was the thing in the ceremony which is principally significant of the truth intended to be inculcated, it would be essential; but if the mode of applying water has nothing to do with the <a name='g10010' href='../../../rf/gl/e.html#emblematical' target='gl'>emblematical</a> signification of the ordinance, it is an indifferent circumstance; as much so as whether baptism be administered in a vessel or in a river; or whether in the Lord's Supper, leavened or unleavened bread be used; or whether we recline or sit upright in partaking of this ordinance. And in regard to indifferent, incidental circumstances, which do not enter into the essence of the sacrament, there is no obligation to follow what all know was the practice of Christ and the apostles; as it is certain that in the first institution of the sacred supper, they reclined on couches, used unleavened bread, and partook of it in the evening, but we do not feel bound to imitate any of these things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The baptism of the children of those who themselves were in covenant with God, though not expressly</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='175'>175</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">mentioned in Scripture, is a practice supported by good and sufficient reasons. It cannot be supposed that under the gospel dispensation, the privileges of the offspring of believers are less than under the Jewish. But we know that by God's command, circumcision, the sign of the covenant, was administered to all the males. They were thus brought externally within the bonds of the covenant; and although the external rite of initiation has been changed, there is no intimation given that the children of believers were to be henceforth excluded from the visible church.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Christ was displeased with his disciples for hindering little children to come unto him, "for," said he, "of such is the kingdom of heaven. And he took them in his arms and blessed them." [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/Mark/010.html#014' target='kj'>Mark</a> <a href='../../../xr/Mark/010/014.html' target='xr'>10:14</a>,16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Household baptism was <a href='../../../rf/gl/p.html#practised' target='gl'>practised</a> by the apostles, and children form a part of most households.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Infants are depraved and need the washing of regeneration, and are capable of being regenerated; and this renovation baptism does strikingly represent. The practice may be traced up to the earliest period of the church, and was then universal in all parts of the world. It is scarcely credible that so great a change should have become universal, in the church, without being noticed by any writer of ecclesiastical history.</p>
