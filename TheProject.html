<span style="font-size: 12pt ">
<p>The Encyclopedia Puritannica Project (EPP) is an inter-denominational
federation of Christians who are committed to the orthodox truths of Scripture.
We believe these truths to be well understood, articulated, and applied by the
Puritans and other Reformed teachers—both past and present. Many of their works have
been forgotten by the modern church and have thus become
practically inaccessible. It is our desire to see these works, among the best in the
history of Christendom, go forth to the nations once again. This project, begun
in 1998, is dedicated to the accomplishment of this task.
</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, after the advent of the scanner and OCR software, it
became possible to convert printed material to computer text with relative
ease. In 1998, EPP began to harness these technologies in order to produce
quality digital texts from Puritan and Reformed books. Our long-term
goal is to make <i>every</i> public domain, Puritan book available as
digital text.</p>
<p>EPP puts a strong emphasis on textual quality. To ensure faithfulness to the
original source, we usually proofread our digital text back to the printed book
several times. We also refrain from editing or modernizing the text,
other than correcting obvious printing errors and standardizing such things
as Bible references and dates. We desire to leave the text just as it was printed.
