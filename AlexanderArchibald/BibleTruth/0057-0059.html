<p align="center" style="text-align:center" class="msonormal"><span style="letter-spacing:1.0pt">CREATION</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">The first information which the Bible gives us, is of the creation of all things out of nothing, in the space of six days. No other book gives any satisfactory account of the creation of the world, or of the origin of the human race. The Bible does not profess to inform us when the substance of the heavens and the earth, was created; but it assures us that it had a beginning, and that God was its creator. When the time arrived for the creation of man upon the earth, the confused and shapeless mass which was covered with darkness, under the forming and creative agency of the Almighty, began to assume a new appearance. And the effects produced were not wrought instantly, but day after day, for six consecutive days. On the first day, light was created, for God said "Let there be light, and there was light." [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/Gen/001.html#003' target='kj'>Gen</a> <a href='../../../xr/Gen/001/003.html' target='xr'>1:3</a>] On the second day, God formed the firmament or atmosphere, which separated between the water in the seas, and that held suspended in the clouds, or invisibly in the air. On the third day, the waters were collected into the basin prepared for them, and were separated from the earth or dry land, which now became visible; and on this day, also, the earth was planted with every kind of herb yielding seed, and tree yielding fruit after their kinds respectively, with the power of propagating their species. On the fourth day, the luminaries of heaven were formed, or then began to shine upon the earth; the sun to rule the day,</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='58'>58</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">and the moon to rule the night; and also the stars. If it be asked how light could exist and form the day, before the creation of the sun, it must be confessed that our knowledge of the elements of matter is very indistinct and imperfect. The question proceeds on the supposition that light is a substance which comes out of the sun by emanation: but it is much more reasonable to believe, that light is nothing more than a certain condition of a widely diffused fluid, which when excited produces in us the sense of sight; just as another fluid when agitated, by its undulations produces in us the sense of hearing. On this subject we assert nothing; but if the theory mentioned will remove the difficulty, it is a proper answer to the question. But even if the sun were a body of light, the substance of light might have been created before it was conglomerated into one great body; or, the sun might not have been visible till the fourth day. On the fifth day, the water and air were replenished with living inhabitants, with constitutions, instincts, and senses, exactly suited to the element in which they were placed. On the sixth day, the earth was stocked with beasts, and reptiles of every species.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">And, finally, a council was, as it were, called in heaven, when the crowning work of creation was about to be produced; that is, the adorable Trinity deliberated, speaking after the manner of men. "And God said, Let us make man in our image, and after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every thing that creepeth on the earth." [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/Gen/001.html#026' target='kj'>Gen</a> <a href='../../../xr/Gen/001/026.html' target='xr'>1:26</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">As God is a spirit, and has no bodily parts, what is here said of his "image and likeness" must relate to his spiritual and moral nature. As man was created an immortal, intelligent spirit, in this respect, he bears</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='59'>59</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">a resemblance to his Creator; but we have stronger evidence for referring these words to the moral image of God. For the apostle Paul, when speaking of the renewal of man in the image of God, makes it to consist in "righteousness and true holiness," (<a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/Eph/004.html#024' target='kj'>Eph</a> <a href='../../../xr/Eph/004/024.html' target='xr'>4:24</a>.) And, in another place, he makes this image to consist in "knowledge:" "And have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of Him that created him," in which last words, there is a plain reference to the history of man's creation, in Genesis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">But, as it was not judged to be good that man should be alone, his Creator, in great kindness, formed for him a suitable companion, a woman taken from his own side, a help meet for him, and the mother of all living. To the man was given the name, Adam, the import of which is "red," and to the woman the name Eve, which signifies "living."</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">God pronounced all that he had created "good," "very good." Nothing imperfect ever came from the hands of God. All creatures were not made equal; and in respect to constitution some are more perfect than others; but every thing is perfect in its kind. In creation, as far as it is subjected to our view, there is a beautiful gradation of creatures from the most exalted angel down to the minutest atom; and among animated creatures there is a scale of perfection, according to which one living creature rises above another by almost insensible degrees. And among the creatures there is observable a mutual dependence of one upon another; and in the whole there is an astonishing harmony; or if there should be the appearance of disorder and confusion in some things, it must be attributed to our ignorance; for as far as we can understand the works of God, every thing seems to be in its proper place, and governed by laws adapted to its nature.</p>
