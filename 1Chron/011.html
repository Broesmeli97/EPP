<a name='001' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/001.html' target='xr'>1.</a> Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we <i>are</i> thy bone and thy flesh.<br>
<a name='002' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou <i>wast</i> he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which <i>is</i> Jebus; where the Jebusites <i>were</i>, the inhabitants of the land.<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which <i>is</i> the city of David.<br>
<a name='006' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/006.html' target='xr'>6.</a> And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.<br>
<a name='007' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts <i>was</i> with him.<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> These also <i>are</i> the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, <i>and</i> with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> And this <i>is</i> the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain <i>by him</i> at one time.<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> And after him <i>was</i> Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who <i>was one</i> of the three mighties.<br>
<a name='013' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/013.html' target='xr'>13.</a> He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.<br>
<a name='014' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/014.html' target='xr'>14.</a> And they set themselves in the midst of <i>that</i> parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved <i>them</i> by a great deliverance.<br>
<a name='015' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/015.html' target='xr'>15.</a> Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.<br>
<a name='016' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/016.html' target='xr'>16.</a> And David <i>was</i> then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison <i>was</i> then at Bethlehem.<br>
<a name='017' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/017.html' target='xr'>17.</a> And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that <i>is</i> at the gate!<br>
<a name='018' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/018.html' target='xr'>18.</a> And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that <i>was</i> by the gate, and took <i>it</i>, and brought <i>it</i> to David: but David would not drink <i>of</i> it, but poured it out to the LORD,<br>
<a name='019' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/019.html' target='xr'>19.</a> And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with <i>the jeopardy of</i> their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.<br>
<a name='020' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/020.html' target='xr'>20.</a> And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew <i>them</i>, and had a name among the three.<br>
<a name='021' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/021.html' target='xr'>21.</a> Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the <i>first</i> three.<br>
<a name='022' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/022.html' target='xr'>22.</a> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.<br>
<a name='023' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/023.html' target='xr'>23.</a> And he slew an Egyptian, a man of <i>great</i> stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand <i>was</i> a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.<br>
<a name='024' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/024.html' target='xr'>24.</a> These <i>things</i> did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.<br>
<a name='025' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/025.html' target='xr'>25.</a> Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the <i>first</i> three: and David set him over his guard.<br>
<a name='026' href='../../xr/1Chron/011/026.html' target='xr'>26.</a> Also the valiant men of the armies <i>were</i>, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,<br>
