<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">All the doctrines and duties of religion have relation to a future state. All religion is founded on the supposition that man will live after the death of the body. The importance of any doctrine or religious institution, depends very much on its bearing on the future destinies of men. Religion, therefore, teaches its votaries to be much occupied with the contemplation of the unseen world. It is especially the province of faith to fix the attention of the mind on these awful but invisible realities, and by this means to draw off the too eager affections from the objects of the present world. Of whatever else men may doubt, they cannot be <a name='g10010' href='../../../rf/gl/s.html#sceptical' target='gl'>sceptical</a> in regard to death. The evidences of the certainty of this event to all, are so multiplied, and so frequently obtruded on our attention, that all know that it is appointed for them once to die; and yet, notwithstanding this certainty, and the frequent mementos which we have, most men are but slightly impressed with their mortality, until death actually comes near, and eternity, with its awful realities, begins to open before them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Death is, according to Scripture, "the wages of</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='195'>195</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">sin." [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/Rom/006.html#023' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/006/023.html' target='xr'>6:23</a>] By sin death entered into the world. The death of the body is a part of the punishment of sin; except in the case of the believer, who is freed from the condemnation of the law; and to whom death, though frightful and painful, is no curse, but rather a blessing. For, by the death of Christ, as his Surety, the penalty of the law, has been exhausted. "There is no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus." [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/Rom/008.html#001' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/008/001.html' target='xr'>8:1</a>] To them "it is a gain to die." [<a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/Phil/001.html#021' target='kj'>Phil</a> <a href='../../../xr/Phil/001/021.html' target='xr'>1:21</a>] To them, the monster has no sting. To them, death is a deliverance from sin and suffering, and an entrance into perfect holiness and happiness. As soon as the true Christian departs, he is with Christ, and is like him, and beholds his glory. Therefore, Paul in his inventory of the rich possessions of the saints, reckons death as one: "For all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos, or Cephas, or things present, or things to come, or life or <i>death</i>, all are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's." [<a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/1Cor/003.html#021' target='kj'>1 Cor</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Cor/003/021.html' target='xr'>3:21</a>-23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">All we know of death is, that it is a separation of the soul from the body; the consequence of which to the latter is, an immediate disorganization and corruption. As it was taken from the dust, so it returns to dust again. But as to the soul, being essentially living and active, it continues its conscious exercises, but in what way, when deprived of its usual organs, we cannot tell. As all our experience has been in <a href='../../../rf/gl/c.html#connexion' target='gl'>connexion</a> with bodily organs, we of course can know nothing of the exercises of mind in a state where no such organs are possessed. All attempts, therefore, to imagine what the condition of the soul in a separate state is, must be vain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">But we need not be perplexed or troubled on account of our ignorance of the future state. We may well trust, in this case, as in others, our divine Redeemer</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='196'>196</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">and faithful Friend, to arrange all matters for his own glory, and for our benefit. The gracious declaration, that "all things work together for good to them who love God, and are the called according to his purpose," [<a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/Rom/008.html#028' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/008/028.html' target='xr'>8:28</a>] is not only true, in relation to their pilgrimage on earth, but also in regard to their passage through the valley of the shadow of death; so that they need fear no evil, for the great Shepherd has promised to be with them, and to comfort them, with his rod and his staff; "When heart and flesh fail, he will be the strength of their heart, and their portion for ever." "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints." [<a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/Ps/073.html#026' target='kj'>Ps</a> <a href='../../../xr/Ps/073/026.html' target='xr'>73:26</a>; <a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/Ps/116.html#015' target='kj'>Ps</a> <a href='../../../xr/Ps/116/015.html' target='xr'>116:15</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Although little is revealed respecting the mode of existence and enjoyment in a separate state, for the plain reason, that no description could be understood by us; yet we may confidently trust our blessed Redeemer to provide for the guidance and comfort of the soul, when it enters an unknown world. When Lazarus died, angels stood ready to receive and convoy his departing spirit; and we have no reason to think that this favour was peculiar to this saint; but rather that it was recorded in this instance, to teach us, that the same might be expected in every case of the death of a true believer.</p>
