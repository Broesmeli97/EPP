<a name='001' href='../../xr/1John/004/001.html' target='xr'>1.</a> Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.<br>
<a name='002' href='../../xr/1John/004/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1John/004/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that <i>spirit</i> of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1John/004/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1John/004/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.<br>
<a name='006' href='../../xr/1John/004/006.html' target='xr'>6.</a> We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.<br>
<a name='007' href='../../xr/1John/004/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1John/004/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1John/004/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1John/004/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son <i>to be</i> the propitiation for our sins.<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1John/004/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1John/004/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.<br>
<a name='013' href='../../xr/1John/004/013.html' target='xr'>13.</a> Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.<br>
<a name='014' href='../../xr/1John/004/014.html' target='xr'>14.</a> And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son <i>to be</i> the Saviour of the world.<br>
<a name='015' href='../../xr/1John/004/015.html' target='xr'>15.</a> Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.<br>
<a name='016' href='../../xr/1John/004/016.html' target='xr'>16.</a> And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.<br>
<a name='017' href='../../xr/1John/004/017.html' target='xr'>17.</a> Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.<br>
<a name='018' href='../../xr/1John/004/018.html' target='xr'>18.</a> There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.<br>
<a name='019' href='../../xr/1John/004/019.html' target='xr'>19.</a> We love him, because he first loved us.<br>
<a name='020' href='../../xr/1John/004/020.html' target='xr'>20.</a> If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?<br>
<a name='021' href='../../xr/1John/004/021.html' target='xr'>21.</a> And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.<br>
