Welcome to Version 2.0 of the Encyclopedia Puritannica Project CD! We trust that you will find this CD to be both enjoyable and edifying.<br><br>

This product is basically a massive web site on CD. It contains thousands of web page files, all carefully organized and linked together to form the EPP product. You browse its contents in much the same way you browse the Internet. You navigate this CD by clicking links (initially highlighted in <b>red</b>) that jump you from one place to another. If you want to go back to a previous page, you click your web browser's <b>back</b> button. This tutorial is designed to teach you how to use the different links that are on this CD, and it assumes you are reasonably comfortable with browsing the internet.<br><br>

After you have inserted the CD into your computer, your web browser should start automatically and load up an introductory web page. (If your browser does not start automatically, navigate to your CD-ROM drive and open the <code>EPP.html</code> file on the CD.) Here you can find information about the Project and support information for the CD. Click the GET STARTED button to continue.<br><br>

<span class="TutorialSubSection"><a name="MeetTheFrames">Meet the Frames</a></span><br><br>

<p>
The main working area is organized into five rectangular areas (called <b>frames</b>). They are arranged and colored like this:
<br><br>
<table border="1" align="center">
<tr><td colspan="2" align="center"><div style="color:black; background-color: #FFFFAA;">NAV</div></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><div style="color:black; background-color: #EEEEEE;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>XR<br>&nbsp;<br></div></td>
<td align="center"><div style="color:black; background-color: #DDFFDD;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>GL<br>&nbsp;<br></div></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><div style="color:black; background-color: #DDDDFF;">&nbsp;<br>KJ<br>&nbsp;<br></div></td>
<td align="center"><div style="color:black; background-color: #FFDDFF;">&nbsp;<br>WK<br>&nbsp;<br></div></td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>
</p>

<p>
Each of these frames will display different kinds of material as you browse. It will be helpful to get familiar with the abbreviations used for each one.

<ul>
<li><span class="RefNAV">&nbsp;NAV&nbsp;</span> (<i>Navigation</i>) displays the primary navigation controls<br><br>
<li><span class="RefXR">&nbsp;XR&nbsp;</span> (<i>Cross-reference</i>) displays the cross-reference entries for Scripture references and glossary words<br><br>
<li><span class="RefGL">&nbsp;GL&nbsp;</span> (<i>Glossary</i>) displays the glossary entries<br><br>
<li><span class="RefKJ">&nbsp;KJ&nbsp;</span> (<i>King James</i>) displays the Bible text, tables of contents, subject lists, etc.<br><br>
<li><span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> (<i>Work</i>) displays the text from books other than the Bible
</ul>
<br>
<i>(Note: Each of these frames can be re-sized by moving your cursor over the white dividing lines, then clicking and dragging. This allows you to customize their proportions to suit your needs.)</i>
</p>

<span class="TutorialSubSection"><a name="TheNavigationBar">The Navigation Bar</a></span><br><br>

The most important thing to be familiar with is the navigation bar. It holds several important links, each of which will take you to a major area of the CD:
<ul>
<li><i>Home</i> returns you to the introductory web page<br><br>

<li><i>Bible</i> gives you access to the complete Bible text and associated cross-references<br><br>

<li><i>Psalter</i> gives you access to the metrical (made-for-singing) version of the Psalms<br><br>

<li><i>Authors</i> shows you a list of all the authors included on this CD<br><br>

<li><i>Titles</i> shows you a list of all the books included on this CD<br><br>

<li><i>Topics</i> sends you to the Topical section of the CD and lets you browse the various subject lists or topical references<br><br>

<li><i>Devotion</i> sends you to the new devotional section where you can get access to the daily Scripture readings and portions from devotional books (such as Spurgeon's <i>Morning and Evening</i>)<br><br>

<li><i>Verse Index </i> shows you a list of every Scripture reference used on this CD and lets you access their cross-references<br><br>

<li><i>Glossary</i> changes the navigation bar into a list of the alphabet so you can browse the glossary terms by first letter<br><br>
</ul>

The following sections discuss these links in more detail. They are not covered in the order in which they appear on the navigation bar, but they have been rearranged to fit the outline of this tutorial.<br><br>


<span class="TutorialSubSection"><a name="FindingScripture">Finding Scripture</a></span><br><br>

 To find a particular Bible text, click the Bible link on the navigation bar. A two-column page will appear in the <span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> frame. The left column holds a list of Bible book names. The right column holds a list of chapters for the currently-selected book. If you click a Bible book name on the left, the chapters for that book will appear on the right. Clicking on a chapter on the right will cause the text for that chapter to appear in the <span class="RefKJ">&nbsp;KJ&nbsp;</span> frame. You can quickly locate any text in the Bible using this two-column list.<br><br>




<span class="TutorialSubSection"><a name="FindingAuthors">Finding Authors</a></span><br><br>

 To find a particular author, click the Authors link on the navigation bar. This will bring up a list of the authors on this CD in the <span class="RefKJ">&nbsp;KJ&nbsp;</span> frame. Clicking an author's name will bring up that author's web page (also in the <span class="RefKJ">&nbsp;KJ&nbsp;</span> frame). Each author has a dedicated web page that lists all his books, Scripture indices and biographical information (if available). You can access the books on this CD by using the author page. More on this later.<br><br>




<span class="TutorialSubSection"><a name="FindingBooks">Finding Books</a></span><br><br>


To a find a particular book, click the Titles link on the navigation bar. A list of all the books on this CD will be shown in the <span class="RefKJ">&nbsp;KJ&nbsp;</span> frame. Clicking on a title will take you to the author's web page (see above) and position your screen over that particular book's list of contents.<br><br>


<span class="TutorialSubSection"><a name="FindingTopics">Finding Topics</a></span><br><br>

To find books or Bible verses about a particular subject, click the Topics link on the navigation bar. A page containing all the current topical resources will display in the <span class="RefKJ">&nbsp;KJ&nbsp;</span> frame. There are several different ways to approach the topical section. One important way is via <b>subject lists</b>. A subject list is a compilation of all the books on the CD related to a particular subject. <i>For example, there is a list called "Family" that has links to four different books about family and domestic duties.</i> You can also approach it by using a Topical Reference, which is a list of Bible verses organized by topic (such as <i>Nave's Topical Bible</i>). By using the cross-reference system (see below) you can find material related to the verses on a particular topic.<br><br>




<span class="TutorialSubSection"><a name="DevotionLink">Using the Devotion Link</a></span><br><br>


Devotion is a brand new section in EPP 2.0 that is designed for personal worship or devotional use. If you click the Devotion link on the navigation bar, a generic calendar will appear in the <span class="RefKJ">&nbsp;KJ&nbsp;</span> frame. (The calendar is represented as grids of numbers, one grid for each month.) Clicking on one of the days in the calendar will show you the devotional page for that day. Several Scripture reading plans (for those reading through the Bible in a year) are provided, as are that day's excerpts from <i>Morning and Evening</i> (C. H. Spurgeon), <i>Morning Exercises</i> (William Jay), and others.<br><br>


<span class="TutorialSubSection"><a name="PsalterLink">Using the Psalter Link</a></span><br><br>


A metrical Psalter has been provided with the CD for the benefit of those who sing Psalms. Click the Psalter link on the navigation bar. This will cause a grid of numbers to appear in the <span class="RefKJ">&nbsp;<span class="RefKJ">&nbsp;KJ&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</span> frame. Each number represents one of the Psalms. Clicking a number will cause the text for that Psalm to appear in the <span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> frame. Some metrical Psalms have more than one rendering, so there will be "A" and "B" links where necessary.<br><br>



<span class="TutorialSubSection"><a name="VerseIndex">Using the Verse Indices</a></span><br><br>


There are three different kinds of Scripture indices. They will all be displayed in the <span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> frame:<br><br>

<ol>
<li>The <i>CD Verse Index</i> is accessed by clicking on the Verse Index link on the navigation bar. The list will display in the <span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> frame. Over 97% of the verses in the Bible are (at least once) directly referenced in one of the EPP works.  <br><br>
<li>The <i>Author Index</i> is accessed through the author page by clicking the "Scripture Index" link beneath the author's name (top most on the page).<br><br>
<li>The <i>Book Index</i> is accessed through the author page by clicking the "Scripture Index" link to the right of the book's name.<br><br>
</ol>

In all the indices, a reference to an entire Bible chapter (such as Exod 3) will also appear as an entry. It will link to the cross-reference list for the first verse of that chapter.<br><br>



<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

<br><span class="TutorialSection">Links</span><hr><br><br>

The following sections include <i>Instructions</i> paragraphs. These instructions give you a "hands on" example of the type of link being demonstrated.<br><br>


<span class="TutorialSubSection"><a name="TheXR">The Cross-reference</a></span><br><br>

<i>The cross-reference will be described in general here. Specific examples follow.</i><br><br>

Whenever you come across a reference to a Bible verse on this CD (e.g., Rom 8:38, Gen 1:1, Exod 3), whether it be in a book, a Scripture index, etc., it will appear as a link. Bible verse links have two parts: <br><br>
<ol>
<li>Clicking the <b>book name</b> (such as "Rom" or "Gen") displays the text of the verse along with its chapter in the <span class="RefKJ">&nbsp;KJ&nbsp;</span> frame. This allows you to instantly look up Bible verses without having to flip through the pages in a Bible.<br><br>
<li>Clicking the <b>chapter and/or verse number</b> (such as "8:38", "1:1" or "3") displays a cross-reference list for that verse in the <span class="RefXR">&nbsp;XR&nbsp;</span> frame. References to entire chapters display the cross-reference list for the first verse of that chapter. In the case of a verse range (Rom 8:38-39) only the first verse in the range is included ("8:38" in the example).
</ol>
<br>

A cross-reference list would look something like this:<br><br>

<div style="color: brown; background-color: antiquewhite;"><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><span style="size:10pt; font-family: sans-serif">— Commentary —</span><br></b>

</div><br><br>

This list shows every place where a particular verse is directly used on the CD. Each entry is a link. Clicking an entry would display that book in the <span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> frame and position your screen to the page where that verse is used. Each verse in the Bible has its own cross-reference list.<br><br>

Notice that the list is divided into three categories: Commentary, Major, and Minor.<br><br>
<ol>
<li><b>Commentary</b> references link specifically to sections of Bible commentaries (Matthew Poole's or Matthew Henry's, for example) where those verses are exposited.<br><br>
<li><b>Major</b> refers to references used in the "front matter" (table of contents, preface, forward, etc). of a particular book, usually as a thematic verse or the text for a sermon.<br><br>
<li><b>Minor</b> references are occurrences of a verse in the main text of a work, typically as allusions, comments or proof-texts.<br><br>
</ol>

This division of the list allows you to be more flexible in your study. If you want a quick explanation of a text, you could follow a <i>Commentary</i> reference. If you want to do in-depth study or prepare a sermon on a verse, you could look up a <i>Major</i> reference or two. If you are just curious as to how the verse might be used or want to find an apt quotation or illustration, you could look up some of the <i>Minor</i> references.<br><br>


<span class="TutorialSubSection"><a name="ExamplesXR">Examples of Cross-referencing</a></span><br><br>

There are three main ways to access the cross-reference:<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Through a book<br><br>
<li>Through the Bible<br><br>
<li>Through a Scripture Index<br><br>
</ol>
Below are examples of each.<br><br>

<ol>
<li><b>Through a book —</b><br><br><i>Instructions:</i> Click the Titles link on the navigation bar. Click the link for <i>A Brief Compend of Bible Truth</i> by Archibald Alexander. The author page for Archibald Alexander will be displayed in the <span class="RefKJ">&nbsp;KJ&nbsp;</span> frame.<br><br>

Notice that on the author page, each of Alexander's books are divided up into smaller sections (called <b>divisions</b>). Each of these divisions has a name (right column) and a pair of four-digit numbers (left column) associated with it. The four digit numbers represent the page ranges from the original book. (So, 0007-00010 would be pages 7 through 10, which that division spans.) The range "0000-0000" is used to denote the "Front Matter," which includes the table of contents, and any prefaces or introductions for a particular book.<br><br>

<i>Instructions:</i> Click on the <i>0000-0000 (Front Matter)</i> link for <i>A Brief Compend of Bible Truth</i>. The front matter for that book will appear in the <span class="RefKJ">&nbsp;KJ&nbsp;</span> frame. Scroll down to the table of contents.<br><br>

Notice that each of the page numbers in the table of contents is a link. Clicking one of these links displays the text of that book in the <span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> frame, opened to that page. This allows you to quickly browse a book's contents, even easier than you could with the book itself.<br><br>

<i>Instructions:</i> Click on the page link for chapter 29 (page 156), and the text for chapter 29 should appear in the <span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> frame. Scroll down a little and find the reference to Rom 8:38 on page 157. Click on the second part of the verse (8:38) to access the cross-reference.</i><br><br>

As a side note, notice that the cross-reference list (in the <span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> frame) has the reference (Rom 8:38 in this case) at the top of the page as a title. Clicking on this reference will cause the text for that verse to display in the <span class="RefKJ">&nbsp;KJ&nbsp;</span> frame. This link allows you to quickly find the verse if you need to read the text.<br><br>


<li><b>Through the Bible—</b><br><br>
<i>Instructions:</i> Click the Bible link on the navigation bar. The list of book names and chapters should appear in the <span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> frame. Click on Joshua (on the left) then click Josh 24 (on the right). The text for Joshua chapter 24 should appear in the <span class="RefKJ">&nbsp;KJ&nbsp;</span> frame. The verse numbers (to the left of the text) show up as links. Clicking one of these links will bring up the cross-reference list for that verse in the <span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> frame. <br><br>

<li><b>Through a Scripture Index —</b><br><br>
<i>Instructions:</i> Click the Authors link on the navigation bar. From the list of EPP Authors, click "Beeke, Joel R." The author page for Dr. Beeke appears in the <span class="RefKJ">&nbsp;KJ&nbsp;</span> frame. Click the "Scripture Index" link found beneath Dr. Beeke's name. A list of every verse Dr. Beeke uses in all his works on the CD appears in the <span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> frame. You can access the cross-reference for any of these verses by clicking the second part (chapter and/or verse) of the link.

</ol>




<span class="TutorialSubSection"><a name="UsingGlossary">Using the Glossary</a></span><br><br>

A glossary of unusual words and theological terms has been provided with this product to assist you while you are reading. It can be accessed in two ways:<br><br>
<ol>
<li><b>Through the navigation bar —</b><br><br>
<i>Instructions:</i> Click the Glossary link on the navigation bar. The navigation bar will change into a list of the letters of the alphabet. (To change it back, click the Return link.) Click on the "A" link. All the words that begin with "A" in the glossary appear in the <span class="RefGL">&nbsp;GL&nbsp;</span> frame. You can scroll through the list and read the entries. Glossary entries that have no definition are marked as TBD (to be determined).<br><br>

Notice that the glossary words appear as links. Clicking one of the glossary words in the <span class="RefGL">&nbsp;GL&nbsp;</span> frame will cause a cross-reference list for that word to appear in the <span class="RefXR">&nbsp;XR&nbsp;</span> frame. This list functions just like the Bible verse cross-reference, except that it is not divided into three categories.<br><br>

<li><b>Through a book —</b><br><br>
<i>Instructions:</i> Click the Titles link on the navigation bar. Scroll down until you see the <i>Robert Flockhart, The Street Preacher</i> link and click it. You will be sent to the author page for Robert Flockhart. Now click on the "0001-0070 (Before Conversion)" link. Scroll down to page 5. Click on the word <i>halberts</i> (first paragraph). The glossary entry for <i>halberts</i> will appear in the <span class="RefGL">&nbsp;GL&nbsp;</span> frame. Whenever you are reading a book and encounter an unusual word, you can click on it to access its definition immediately. <br><br>

</ol>


<span class="TutorialSubSection"><a name="NavigationLinks">Navigation Links</a></span><br><br>

There are a few other types of links that help you browse the material more quickly.<br><br>
<ol>
<li><b>Division Links —</b><br><br>
<i>Instructions:</i> Click the Authors link on the navigation bar. Scroll down until you see the <i>Gouge, William</i> link and then click on it. Scroll down the William Gouge author page until you see <i>Of Domestic Duties</i>. Click the "0179-0213 (Treatise 2a)" link. The text for the first part of Gouge's second treatise will appear in the <span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> frame.<br><br>

Notice that at the top of the <span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> frame there are <b>"&lt;&lt;"</b> and <b>"&gt;&gt;"</b> links. These links let you skip to the next or previous section respectively. Clicking the <b>"&lt;&lt;"</b> will send you back to the previous division (Treatise 1 in this case). Clicking <b>"&gt;&gt;"</b> will send you forward to next division (Treatise 2b). These links will appear in several places throughout the CD. (For example, there are two pairs at the top of each Bible chapter text, one to skip from book to book and another to skip from chapter to chapter.)<br><br>

<li><b>Page Numbers —</b><br><br>
<i>Instructions:</i> Click the Titles link in the navigation bar. Scroll down and click on the <i>Gospel Worship, Vol. 1 of 2</i> link. Click on the "0051-0057 (Gospel Worship)" link. The text for the "Gospel Worship" chapter appears in the <span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> frame. Notice that each of the page numbers is a link. Clicking any of these page numbers will cause the Front Matter for the work (<i>Gospel Worship</i>, in this case) to appear in the <span class="RefKJ">&nbsp;KJ&nbsp;</span> frame. These links allow you to get your bearings if you followed a cross-reference and landed in the middle of a large book.<br><br>

<li><b>Footnotes —</b><br><br>
<i>Instructions:</i> Click the Authors link on the navigation bar. Scroll down and click on the "Boettner, Loraine" link. Scroll down and click on the "0051-0053 (Section I, Chapter 8)" link under The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination. The text for chapter 8 will appear in the
<span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> frame. At the end of the 2nd paragraph there is a "[2]" link. This is a footnote reference. Click on the [2], and you will jump to the text of that footnote (at the bottom of that division). You can return to where you were reading by clicking the BACK button on your browser or by clicking on the [2] label to the left of the footnote text.<br><br>

<li><b>Psalm links —</b><br><br>
<i>Instructions:</i> Click the Bible link on the navigation bar. The two-column Bible list will appear in the <span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> frame. Click the Psalms link (on the left) and then the Ps 119 link (on the right). The text for Psalm 119 will appear in the <span class="RefWK">&nbsp;KJ&nbsp;</span> frame. Notice that to the left of the verse number there are "(sp)" links. Clicking one of these (sp) links will open to the text of the metrical Scottish Psalter (hence "sp") in the <span class="RefWK">&nbsp;WK&nbsp;</span> frame. These links allow you to quickly compare the two translations. <br><br>

Note, when you are looking at the text of the <i>metrical</i> Psalter, the verse numbers appear as links. Clicking one of these verse numbers will open to the corresponding Bible text for that Psalm in the <span class="RefKJ">&nbsp;KJ&nbsp;</span> frame. The verse numbers for the <i>non-metrical</i> Bible text will still open to the cross-reference list in the <span class="RefXR">&nbsp;XR&nbsp;</span> frame. In some cases there are more than one metrical rendering (as in the case of Psalm 6). In these cases there will be "(sp1)" and "(sp2)" links in the Bible text, one for each rendering.
