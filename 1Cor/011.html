<a name='001' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/001.html' target='xr'>1.</a> Be ye followers of me, even as I also <i>am</i> of Christ.<br>
<a name='002' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered <i>them</i> to you.<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman <i>is</i> the man; and the head of Christ <i>is</i> God.<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> Every man praying or prophesying, having <i>his</i> head covered, dishonoureth his head.<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with <i>her</i> head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.<br>
<a name='006' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/006.html' target='xr'>6.</a> For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.<br>
<a name='007' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> For a man indeed ought not to cover <i>his</i> head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> For this cause ought the woman to have power on <i>her</i> head because of the angels.<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> For as the woman <i>is</i> of the man, even so <i>is</i> the man also by the woman; but all things of God.<br>
<a name='013' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/013.html' target='xr'>13.</a> Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?<br>
<a name='014' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/014.html' target='xr'>14.</a> Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?<br>
<a name='015' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/015.html' target='xr'>15.</a> But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for <i>her</i> hair is given her for a covering.<br>
<a name='016' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/016.html' target='xr'>16.</a> But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.<br>
<a name='017' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/017.html' target='xr'>17.</a> Now in this that I declare <i>unto you</i> I praise <i>you</i> not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.<br>
<a name='018' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/018.html' target='xr'>18.</a> For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.<br>
<a name='019' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/019.html' target='xr'>19.</a> For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.<br>
<a name='020' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/020.html' target='xr'>20.</a> When ye come together therefore into one place, <i>this</i> is not to eat the Lord's supper.<br>
<a name='021' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/021.html' target='xr'>21.</a> For in eating every one taketh before <i>other</i> his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.<br>
<a name='022' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/022.html' target='xr'>22.</a> What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise <i>you</i> not.<br>
<a name='023' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/023.html' target='xr'>23.</a> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the <i>same</i> night in which he was betrayed took bread:<br>
<a name='024' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/024.html' target='xr'>24.</a> And when he had given thanks, he brake <i>it</i>, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.<br>
<a name='025' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/025.html' target='xr'>25.</a> After the same manner also <i>he took</i> the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink <i>it</i>, in remembrance of me.<br>
<a name='026' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/026.html' target='xr'>26.</a> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.<br>
<a name='027' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/027.html' target='xr'>27.</a> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink <i>this</i> cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.<br>
<a name='028' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/028.html' target='xr'>28.</a> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of <i>that</i> bread, and drink of <i>that</i> cup.<br>
<a name='029' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/029.html' target='xr'>29.</a> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.<br>
<a name='030' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/030.html' target='xr'>30.</a> For this cause many <i>are</i> weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.<br>
<a name='031' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/031.html' target='xr'>31.</a> For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.<br>
<a name='032' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/032.html' target='xr'>32.</a> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.<br>
<a name='033' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/033.html' target='xr'>33.</a> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.<br>
<a name='034' href='../../xr/1Cor/011/034.html' target='xr'>34.</a> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.<br>
