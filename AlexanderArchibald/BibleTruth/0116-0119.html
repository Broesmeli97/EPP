<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">The offices of Christ have long been divided into three; the <a name='g10020' href='../../../rf/gl/p.html#prophetical' target='gl'>prophetical</a>, sacerdotal, and regal; and this is not an arbitrary distinction, but is founded in the wants of men; for he who undertakes to save sinners must be qualified to deliver them from their ignorance, from their guilt, and from their depravity; and he must have power to protect them from all their enemies, and raise them from death and the grave, and bring them to the possession of eternal life. When Christ was upon earth, most of his time, during his public ministry, was spent in teaching. And in the exercise of this office, "He taught with authority, and not as the scribes." [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/Matt/007.html#029' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/007/029.html' target='xr'>7:29</a>; <a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/Mark/001.html#022' target='kj'>Mark</a> <a href='../../../xr/Mark/001/022.html' target='xr'>1:22</a>] Even in the judgment of his enemies, "never man <a href='../../../rf/gl/s.html#spake' target='gl'>spake</a> like this man." [<a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/John/007.html#046' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/007/046.html' target='xr'>7:46</a>] But, when about</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">to leave the world, he promised to his disciples another teacher, who should remain with them, and lead them into all truth, and who should bring to their remembrance whatever he had said to them. Thus, he now exercises the office of a prophet by his word and Spirit, by which agency all the children of God are taught of him; and through faith in the holy Scriptures, are made wise unto salvation. By the law they obtain the knowledge of sin; by the gospel they are made acquainted with the only remedy; and by the influence of the Holy Spirit are enabled "to grow in grace, and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ." [<a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/2Pet/003.html#018' target='kj'>2 Pet</a> <a href='../../../xr/2Pet/003/018.html' target='xr'>3:18</a>] As Moses prophesied that the Lord should raise up a prophet like unto him; that is, one who should be the author of a new dispensation; so, the same glorious person is predicted in the Psalms, as a priest, not after the order of Aaron, but after the order of Melchizedek; a priest who should have no predecessor nor successor, but should possess in himself an everlasting priesthood; and who, by the sacrifice of himself, should be able to accomplish what the Levitical priests never could. What they performed and exhibited in shadows, he executed in substance. As their sacrifices and oblations were to remove ceremonial guilt and uncleanness, he, by the one offering of himself, obtained eternal redemption for us. And as the high priest, on the great day of atonement, after slaying the sin-offering, both for himself and the people, carried the blood into the most holy place, and sprinkled it on the mercy seat; so Christ, the High Priest of our profession, having offered himself as a sacrifice on the cross, has entered into the most holy place, not made with hands, where he appears before God, to present, as it were, the "blood which cleanseth from all sin." [<a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/1John/001.html#007' target='kj'>1 John</a> <a href='../../../xr/1John/001/007.html' target='xr'>1:7</a>] "For Christ is not entered into the holy</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='118'>118</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">places, made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us." "For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified," (<a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/Heb/009.html#024' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/009/024.html' target='xr'>9:24</a>; <a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/Heb/010.html#014' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/010/014.html' target='xr'>10:14</a>.) Two things belong to the office of priesthood: first, oblation, or the offering a sacrifice; secondly, the sprinkling the blood, or the presentment of the oblation before God. This, in Scripture, is called intercession; because, on the ground of having complied with the stipulated conditions in the covenant of redemption, the Mediator has a right to claim the deliverance of those for whom he undertook. This, therefore, is a very necessary part of the <a name='g10040' href='../../../rf/gl/m.html#mediatorial' target='gl'>mediatorial</a> work. It is the moving cause of all that is done in the application of the purchased redemption. Therefore it is written, "that he is able to save to the uttermost all that come to God by him; seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them." [<a name='s10070' href='../../../kj/Heb/007.html#025' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/007/025.html' target='xr'>7:25</a>] And here we see the reason why the true believer never comes again into condemnation, notwithstanding all his sins and infirmities; because he has an Advocate with the Father, who is the propitiation for his sins. As fast as he contracts guilt, his sins are blotted out; or, rather, as he has the righteousness of Christ set down to his account, he cannot come into condemnation. "If God be for us, who can be against us?" [<a name='s10080' href='../../../kj/Rom/008.html#031' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/008/031.html' target='xr'>8:31</a>] "It is God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth? Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? Shall Christ, that died, or rather is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us?" [<a name='s10090' href='../../../kj/Rom/008.html#034' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/008/034.html' target='xr'>8:34</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The Christian then, in all his trials, under all his burdens, when tempted to despond or despair, should have recourse to the cross, and should look for comfort</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">to the prevalent intercessions of his great High Priest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">In <a name='s10100' href='../../../kj/Ps/002.html#006' target='kj'>Ps</a> <a href='../../../xr/Ps/002/006.html' target='xr'>2:6</a> it is written, "I will set my king upon my holy hill of Zion." And Jesus Christ was born a king. He was lineally descended from David, to whose family the regal authority was promised for ever. When Pilate interrogated him, whether he was a king, he did not deny it, but admitted and asserted it, saying, "Thou sayest that I am a king. For this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth." [<a name='s10110' href='../../../kj/John/018.html#037' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/018/037.html' target='xr'>18:37</a>] After his resurrection, he declared to his disciples, "all power in heaven, and in earth, is given unto me." [<a name='s10120' href='../../../kj/Matt/028.html#018' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/028/018.html' target='xr'>28:18</a>] And we read, "that angels and principalities are subject to him." [<a name='s10130' href='../../../kj/1Pet/003.html#022' target='kj'>1 Pet</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Pet/003/022.html' target='xr'>3:22</a>] He is made "head over all things for his church, which is his body." [<i>cf</i>. <a name='s10140' href='../../../kj/Eph/001.html#022' target='kj'>Eph</a> <a href='../../../xr/Eph/001/022.html' target='xr'>1:22</a>; <a name='s10150' href='../../../kj/Col/001.html#018' target='kj'>Col</a> <a href='../../../xr/Col/001/018.html' target='xr'>1:18</a>] He is therefore called "the King of kings and Lord of lords." [<a name='s10160' href='../../../kj/1Tim/006.html#015' target='kj'>1 Tim</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Tim/006/015.html' target='xr'>6:15</a>; <a name='s10170' href='../../../kj/Rev/019.html#016' target='kj'>Rev</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rev/019/016.html' target='xr'>19:16</a>] "For he must reign until he hath put all enemies under his feet." [<a name='s10180' href='../../../kj/1Cor/015.html#025' target='kj'>1 Cor</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Cor/015/025.html' target='xr'>15:25</a>] In the exercise of his regal office, he governs all providential events and revolutions, so as to promote the ultimate glory and triumph of his kingdom. He holds under restraint all those enemies, who would otherwise destroy his sheep. Over these he watches with a shepherd's care. In the exercise of his regal office he will judge the world in righteousness. "We must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ." [<i>cf</i>. <a name='s10190' href='../../../kj/Rom/014.html#010' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/014/010.html' target='xr'>14:10</a>; <a name='s10200' href='../../../kj/2Cor/005.html#010' target='kj'>2 Cor</a> <a href='../../../xr/2Cor/005/010.html' target='xr'>5:10</a>] "When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory. Then shall the King say to those on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."
