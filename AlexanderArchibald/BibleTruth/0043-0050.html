<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">The proof of the Deity of the Son of God is the main point in establishing the doctrine of the Trinity; for if it can be clearly shown that there is a second person in the divine essence, there will be small repugnance to the admission of a third.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">And here it may be observed, that the appellation "Son of God," is remarkable. A son is always of the same nature with the father who begat him, and possesses the same attributes. It is true, Adam, in Luke's genealogy of Christ, is called the son of God, by which no more is to be understood but that God was his immediate Creator. But Christ is called not only <i>the Son of God</i>, but <i>His</i> "<i>only begotten son</i>." (<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/John/001.html#014' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/001/014.html' target='xr'>1:14</a>.) And angels are called "sons of God," [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/Job/001.html#006' target='kj'>Job</a> <a href='../../../xr/Job/001/006.html' target='xr'>1:6</a>; <a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/Job/002.html#001' target='kj'>Job</a> <a href='../../../xr/Job/002/001.html' target='xr'>2:1</a>] as being immediately created by him; but the apostle Paul distinguishes the <a name='g10010' href='../../../rf/gl/s.html#sonship' target='gl'>sonship</a> of Christ from that of angels, in that remarkable passage in <a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/Heb/001.html#005' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/001/005.html' target='xr'>1:5</a>-8, where he says, "For unto which of the angels said he at any time, thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? And again, when he bringeth in the first-begotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire. But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever." [<a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/Heb/001.html#007' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/001/007.html' target='xr'>1:7</a>-8]</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='44'>44</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">Here we learn that the Son is not one of the angels, for he is clearly distinguished from them all. Not only so, but the angels were commanded to worship him, when he made his first appearance in the world. Now, he whom angels worship, can be no other than God. Was it ever heard of, or any where read, that the angels were commanded to worship one another? No: but they did receive a command to worship the Son. This shows that Christ was not called Son, merely on account of his miraculous birth, or his designation to office, as Mediator, or his resurrection from the dead. All these may serve to show that he is the Son of God; but he was Son from the beginning—by nature a Son—eternally begotten; for as Son, he is to be worshipped by the most exalted angels of heaven. And while he is addressed by the Father as a Son, he is emphatically addressed as God. "<i>Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever</i>." [<a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/Heb/001.html#008' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/001/008.html' target='xr'>1:8</a>] To which of the angels was ever an address like this made? As these words are a quotation from <a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/Ps/045.html#006' target='kj'>Ps</a> <a href='../../../xr/Ps/045/006.html' target='xr'>45:6</a>, by turning to the passage we find, that the person addressed is called <i>the King</i>, and is addressed as the <i>Most Mighty</i>. There is, moreover, another argument for the eternity of Christ, contained in this pregnant passage, which is of the most conclusive nature. Indeed, it is so cogent, that this being impartially weighed, all further arguments seem to be superfluous. It is derived from the fact, plainly declared by the apostle, and made prominent in several other parts of Scripture, that Christ, here called the Son of God, is the <i>Creator</i> of the universe. Surely he who created all things must be God; or all distinction between God and the creature is obliterated. How do we know that there is a God, but by the creation? The idea that the power of creation may</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='45'>45</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">be delegated to a creature, is the same as to suppose that a creature may be rendered omnipotent and infinitely wise; that is, that a creature may be endowed with divine attributes; or that there may be another God.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">And as to the notion that Christ was employed in creation as an instrument, it is still less reasonable, for as creation is an instantaneous work of almighty power, what place was there for any instrumentality? Besides, in the passage under consideration, there is no allusion to any instrument. It is simply and plainly declared, "Thou, Lord, in the beginning, hast laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands." [<a name='s10070' href='../../../kj/Heb/001.html#010' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/001/010.html' target='xr'>1:10</a>] In the second verse, it is indeed said, "By whom He created the worlds;" [<a name='s10080' href='../../../kj/Heb/001.html#002' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/001/002.html' target='xr'>1:2</a>] but in the order of operation, in the persons of the Trinity, the Son is always represented as acting in conformity with the will of the Father; but still as exercising the same power, and possessing the same knowledge. The very name Father indicates, that he is primary in order of existence and of operation: by some, therefore, he has been called the fountain of the Deity. Thus our Lord says, "For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son, to have life in himself." [<a name='s10090' href='../../../kj/John/005.html#026' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/005/026.html' target='xr'>5:26</a>] "All things are delivered to me of my Father, and no man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him." [<a name='s10100' href='../../../kj/Matt/011.html#027' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/011/027.html' target='xr'>11:27</a>] Here the knowledge of the Father by the Son, is put on a level with the knowledge which the Father has of the Son; and the nature of the Son is represented as incomprehensible to all others but the Father, just as the nature of the Father is incomprehensible to all but the Son. An equality in the possession of divine attributes is here as clearly taught, as is possible. Can it be a mere</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='46'>46</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">creature who knows the essence of God, as his essence is known by God? Impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">But let us attend more particularly to the argument from the creation of the heavens and the earth, and all which they contain. There are several other testimonies to this fact, which it may be expedient to bring into view. In <a name='s10110' href='../../../kj/John/001.html#003' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/001/003.html' target='xr'>1:3</a>, Christ, under the name <i>Logos</i>, is not only said to have been in the beginning with God, but to be God; and the evangelist goes on to say, "all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made." [<a name='s10120' href='../../../kj/Job/001.html#003' target='kj'>Job</a> <a href='../../../xr/Job/001/003.html' target='xr'>1:3</a>] He is also declared to be the source of life and of light. "In him was life, and the life was the light of men" [<a name='s10130' href='../../../kj/John/001.html#004' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/001/004.html' target='xr'>1:4</a>]—"That was the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world." [<a name='s10140' href='../../../kj/John/001.html#009' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/001/009.html' target='xr'>1:9</a>] And that there might be no doubt respecting the person denominated Logos, it is said, "And the word (Logos) was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth." [<a name='s10150' href='../../../kj/John/001.html#014' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/001/014.html' target='xr'>1:14</a>] It is reported by some of the earliest of the Christian fathers, that John wrote his gospel for the very purpose of refuting the errors of certain heretics, who denied the divinity of the Son. And whether that was the occasion of his writing or not, he could not have asserted the doctrine more clearly and explicitly than he has done. And how do anti-<a name='g10020' href='../../../rf/gl/t.html#trinitarians' target='gl'>trinitarians</a> evade the force of this passage? The Arians, by maintaining that the Son performed the work of creation by a delegated power, or as an instrument. But this interpretation will not suit the <a name='g10030' href='../../../rf/gl/s.html#socinians' target='gl'>Socinians</a>, and all who deny the existence of Christ before he was born of Mary. They, therefore, have invented a gloss, which certainly no common reader would ever have thought of; and which nothing but dire necessity could ever have induced any one to adopt.</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='47'>47</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">It is, that it is meant that Christ was the author of the new dispensation, and disposed of and regulated every thing in the Christian church. When men are driven to such forced interpretations, it is a clear evidence that they cannot maintain their ground, by solid argument: it is a kind of <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>; and we should be satisfied to leave the matter there. There is no need of an elaborate refutation of what so plainly refutes itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Another remarkable testimony to the fact, that Christ is the creator of all things, is found in <a name='s10160' href='../../../kj/Col/001.html#015' target='kj'>Col</a> <a href='../../../xr/Col/001/015.html' target='xr'>1:15</a>-17: "Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature. For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible; whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him and for him; and he is before all things, and by him all things consist."</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Here, not only the creation of the visible universe is ascribed to the Son, but also all things invisible; and lest any should be disposed to confine this work to inanimate substances, the whole hierarchy of heaven is declared also to have been created by him. The most exalted of the celestial host are his creatures. And not only so, but all things are continually supported by Him. The expression, "firstborn of every creature," [<a name='s10170' href='../../../kj/Col/001.html#015' target='kj'>Col</a> <a href='../../../xr/Col/001/015.html' target='xr'>1:15</a>] has misled many to think that this scripture asserted that Christ was the first formed creature; but the most judicious critics have shown, that this is not the proper meaning of the original term; but the true sense is, "first begotten before all creation;" that is, from eternity. The same idea is expressed, in the last verse cited, "and he is before all things." "From the foundation of the world"—"before the foundation of the</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='48'>48</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">world"—"before all things," are the modes of speech by which an eternity past, is expressed in scripture. One would think, that none could resort to the forced interpretation which has been put on the passage in John, but what else can the <a name='g10040' href='../../../rf/gl/u.html#unitarian' target='gl'>Unitarian</a> do? He has no other refuge from the convincing force of the testimony, unless he should have recourse to the supposition, that the whole passage is spurious; but there is no proof of any such thing. No text in the Bible is more certainly authentic. The <a name='g10050' href='../../../rf/gl/u.html#unitarian' target='gl'>Unitarian</a> is therefore obliged, as before, to pretend that the apostle is not speaking of the creation of the world, but of the setting up the gospel kingdom. If absurdity were stamped on the face of this interpretation when applied to the passage in John, what shall we say of it here, where the heavens and the earth are expressly mentioned; and not only so, but things visible and invisible; and finally, the glorious hosts of heaven, angels, dominions, principalities and powers, are mentioned among his works. And all these he upholds by his power. Is there any passage in the Bible, where the creation of all things is more expressly and particularly ascribed to the Father, than here to the Son? To attempt to apply the language here used, in the midst of a plain didactic discourse, to the setting up of the Christian church, or introducing a new dispensation, is so unreasonable at first view, that there is really no need of a refutation. What could be meant by the heavens and the earth?—What by things visible and invisible? What by the names of the celestial orders? If such an interpretation could be admitted, then the testimonies of the Holy Scriptures would be utterly useless. No text, on any subject could be brought forward in proof of the unity, or of any of the attributes of God, which might not be turned aside with as much show</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='49'>49</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">of reason, as is exhibited in this interpretation. In the text in the gospel of John, they demurred, because the word used for <i>made</i>, was not the one commonly used to express a creation out of nothing, but here we have the very word, used by the Seventy to express the work of creation in <a name='s10180' href='../../../kj/Gen/001.html#000' target='kj'>Gen</a> <a href='../../../xr/Gen/001/000.html' target='xr'>1</a>. In the former case, the objection had no force, but in this there is no foundation for it. This wild notion, by which, in the foregoing testimonies, they would have us by the creation of all things in heaven and earth, to understand the setting up a new kingdom, or introducing a new dispensation after the advent of Christ, cannot possibly be applied to the text in <a name='s10190' href='../../../kj/Heb/001.html#000' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/001/000.html' target='xr'>1</a>; for there it is declared, that the heaven and earth of which he <a href='../../../rf/gl/s.html#spake' target='gl'>spake</a>, the creation of which he ascribed to the Son of God, should perish—and that they should wax old as doth a garment, and that as a <a name='g10070' href='../../../rf/gl/v.html#vesture' target='gl'>vesture</a> they should be folded up and changed. But surely this cannot apply to the kingdom of Christ, or the new creation, for this is everlasting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">If there is a doctrine plainly taught in the Bible, this is one, that Christ is the Creator of all things: and if so, he must be truly God: we have no higher idea of God than Creator of heaven and earth. If another besides the true God may be the Creator, then another besides God possesses those attributes by the manifestation of which in the works of nature, we know that there is a God, and by which his almighty power and infinite wisdom are made known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">It seems unnecessary to adduce other arguments, as this is of itself as demonstrative of the deity of Christ, as if we had a thousand. The mind which can resist this would resist any number. If it were necessary, we could adduce hundreds of texts in which the doctrine</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='50'>50</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">is expressed or implied. We shall, therefore, conclude by observing, that Christ is called Jehovah—the great God—The mighty God, the true God. And arguments for his divinity might be derived from his miracles—from his glorious work of redemption—from the worship and obedience demanded, and from his being appointed the Judge of the quick and the dead—of angels and of men. But it is deemed unnecessary to deduce arguments from all these topics, as what has been said is sufficient.</p>
