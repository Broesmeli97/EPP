<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">The most incomprehensible of all mysteries is, that moral evil should have a place in the universe of an infinitely wise, holy, and powerful God. We could construct a very plausible argument, <i>a priori</i>, to prove from the above premises, that moral evil never could be permitted to exist in the world. But how futile are all <a href='../../../rf/gl/r.html#reasonings' target='gl'>reasonings</a> against facts experienced every moment, and by every man. The philosopher who undertook to demonstrate that there could be no such thing as motion, received the right answer, when the person addressed, uttered not a word, but rose up and walked. So we may answer all arguments against the possibility of the existence of evil, by pointing to the prison, the hospital, and the grave. We need not go so far; we need only refer the sophist to his own experience. Now, if moral evil have an existence, it is evident that pain or natural evil must follow it.</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='205'>205</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">No conviction of the human mind is clearer or stronger than that crime should be visited by punishment. Every judgment of the moral faculty, every feeling of disapprobation at unprovoked injury, every twinge of remorse, furnishes indubitable proof that moral evil should be visited with punishment. From this law, written on the heart, no man can escape. "The wages of sin is death:" [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/Rom/006.html#023' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/006/023.html' target='xr'>6:23</a>] and the very practice of moral evil, involves misery in the very exercise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">But some who cannot but admit that moral evil exists, and that as long as it does exist, there must be misery; yet cannot be reconciled to the doctrine of eternal misery, which seems to be clearly taught in the word of God. That any of God's rational creatures should be doomed to a state of everlasting sin and misery, is indeed an appalling idea; from which the benevolent sympathetic mind would gladly shrink; but as far as reason is concerned, the chief difficulty is admitted, when it is conceded, that sin and misery have an actual existence in the world, and have had from a period near its commencement. For if evil may exist, as it has done, consistently with the Divine attributes, it may exist hereafter—it may exist for ever. When it is argued that sin cannot deserve such a punishment, something is assumed which cannot be known to be true. If sin may exist and be punished for ages, no man can prove that it may not exist for ever, and for ever be the cause of misery. The idea is indeed so painful to our feelings, that unless the will of God had been revealed too clearly to be mistaken, the doctrine of eternal misery would never have been received by any considerable number of persons; but revolting as it is to our sensibilities, it has been from the beginning, the belief of the whole Christian church, with a very few exceptions. We</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">believe this doctrine, simply because we find it plainly written in innumerable passages of Scripture. If there is any art by which this array of testimony can be set aside, then it will be a legitimate inference, that no doctrine is or can be proved from the sacred word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">It is not intended to adduce all the Scripture proofs of this awful doctrine. They may be met with on almost every page of the New Testament. It may not be amiss, however, to cite a few passages, that the reader may have a specimen of the proof texts which may be adduced. There is a sin for which there is no forgiveness, neither in this world nor in the world to come. There was a person, concerning whom our Saviour said, it had been good for him if he had never been born; which can only be true on the supposition, that punishment will be eternal. There were some of whom Christ said, "ye shall die in your sins, [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/John/008.html#024' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/008/024.html' target='xr'>8:24</a>] and where I am thither ye cannot come." [<a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/John/007.html#034' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/007/034.html' target='xr'>7:34</a>] It is said, that many "shall seek to enter into life and shall not be able." [<a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/Luke/013.html#024' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/013/024.html' target='xr'>13:24</a>] Besides, we have not the least intimation that the lost can ever be rendered meet for the heavenly state. Certainly, the society and blasphemy of devils, have no tendency to fit the souls of the damned for the pure joys of the celestial world. And, in confirmation of the common doctrine, we have in Scripture every form of expression which could express eternity of misery. The same terms which are employed to teach the eternal existence of God, and the perpetuity of the happiness of the righteous, are also used to teach the endless sufferings of the finally impenitent. And, for <a href='../../../rf/gl/a.html#aught' target='gl'>aught</a> we know, eternity is an immutable state of existence; and he who is doomed to punishment in another world, must suffer eternally, because the successions of time may have no existence there.</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='207'>207</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">We are not more certainly assured of the perpetuity of future misery, than of the intensity of the torments which must be endured by the wretched creatures who shall be doomed to everlasting banishment from the comfortable presence of God. Whether the fire of hell is a material fire, is an inquiry of no importance. It matters not whether excruciating pain proceeds from a material or immaterial cause. The misery of lost sinners must be inconceivably dreadful, if they should be abandoned to their own feelings of remorse, despair, and the raging of malignant passions, then free from all restraint. This state of misery is spoken of as a place of outer darkness; a lake of fire and brimstone; and a place where the worm dieth not, and where the fire is not quenched. Let every one who is within the reach of mercy, flee from the coming wrath, and take refuge under the outstretched wings of the <i>divine mercy</i>.</p>
