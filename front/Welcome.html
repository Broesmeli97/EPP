Greetings! Welcome to the third release of the EPP CD. To continue on to the content, click the <b>GET STARTED</b> button. For more information about the Project or this CD please consult any of the other links on the left. Current news, updates and status can be found on our <a href="http://www.puritannica.com" target="_new">website</a>.

<b>Note on the Glossary —</b>
<br><br>
Some words in the glossary (such as those that have the old <i>eth</i> ending) have had their cross references removed. This was intended to reduce superfluous linkage. Such words will appear in the glossary, but will not be hyperlinked back to a cross reference page.

<br><br><br>
<b>Note on Greek and Hebrew fonts —</b>
<br><br>

The EPP has provided Greek and Hebrew fonts along with this CD. These fonts need to be registered with your computer in order for the Greek and Hebrew text to show up correctly in your web browser. (Click <a href="GkHbInstructions.html" target="HiMain">here</a> for instructions.) You may use this product without registering the fonts, but the Greek and Hebrew text will appear as gibberish. Those of you who do not read the original languages may choose to ignore this procedure.<br><br>

Updating our texts to incorporate these fonts is still a work in progress. You might find that some of the texts on this CD have <i>{GK}</i> and <i>{HB}</i> symbols substituted in for Greek or Hebrew words. We apologize for this and hope to remedy the problem before much longer.<br><br>
