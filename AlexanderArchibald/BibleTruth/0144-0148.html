<p align="center" style="text-align:center" class="msonormal"><span style="letter-spacing:1.0pt">PRAYER</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">Prayer is a duty dictated by reason. If a child is hungry and wants bread, nature impels it to go to its parent for a supply; and the natural affections of parents to their offspring render them prompt to answer such requests. And, even if they intended beforehand to give the necessary food, in proper season; it is nevertheless pleasing to them that the child should feel its dependence, and come and ask for what it needs. And if this is seen by all to be reasonable and becoming in children toward earthly parents, how much more reasonable and becoming that we should feel our dependence for every good thing on our heavenly Father, and should go to him and ask him to grant to us such things as are necessary for our present and eternal welfare. And on this very principle does our Lord urge upon his disciples the duty of praying for the Holy Spirit, in which gift all spiritual blessings are comprehended. His words are, "And I say unto you, ask and it shall be given you, seek and ye shall find, knock, and it shall be opened unto you, for every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?" [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/Luke/011.html#009' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/011/009.html' target='xr'>11:9</a>-13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Prayer is no more inconsistent with the unchangeable purposes of God, than the use of any other means; for God in forming his purposes had respect to all appropriate means of producing the intended ends, and among these prayer has an important place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">It is a low idea of the efficacy of prayer, to confine it to the good effect which it is adapted to produce on the feelings of the person who offers it. Indeed, if this were believed to be the whole benefit derived from prayer, a great part of the good impression which it makes on the petitioner would be lost. As we obtain the things which we need from earthly parents, by asking; so also, we receive the blessings which we need from our heavenly Father, by praying for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">In how many instances did Moses, by his prayers, avert the judgments of God from the Israelites. The prophet Samuel also, by prayer, obtained a signal victory for the people of Israel over their enemies. But no single instance of the efficacy of prayer, recorded in Scripture, is more remarkable, than that of the prophet Elijah. This case is referred to, by the apostle James, in the following manner. "The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months; and he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit." [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/James/005.html#016' target='kj'>James</a> <a href='../../../xr/James/005/016.html' target='xr'>5:16</a>-18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">In prayer may be properly comprehended all devotional acts of the mind, and the suitable expression of these sentiments in external gestures and words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Adoration is one of the most suitable and solemn</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='146'>146</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">feelings of which a creature is capable, when he comes into the presence of the august majesty of Heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Godly fear, or reverence is another feeling which must be experienced when any just idea is entertained of the Almighty power, terrible majesty, and awful holiness of the Creator. Penitent confession is so appropriate to sinners, in their approaches to God, that no one can have any sense of the divine character and presence, without falling down before him, under a deep impression of entire unworthiness. Even the holiest men, such as Isaiah, Daniel, and the apostle John, were overwhelmed with a feeling of unworthiness, when God manifested himself to them, with something of his majesty and glory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Praise and thanksgiving are exercises of devotion which must be excited into lively exercise, in every pious mind, by the consideration of the wonderful works and munificent dispensations of our heavenly Father; and especially our praise and thanksgiving are due for redeeming love. This part of our devotional exercises will be continued through eternity. The song begun here, will rise to its noblest strains, when the saints in heaven, redeemed by the blood of Christ, and saved by his power, shall, in one grand chorus, sing, "Unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father, to Him be glory and dominion, forever and ever, amen." [<a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/Rev/001.html#005' target='kj'>Rev</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rev/001/005.html' target='xr'>1:5</a>-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">But, that which is more properly denominated prayer, is petition. We approach the throne of grace to ask for such things as we need—Prayer has therefore, been very correctly defined to be "the offering up of our desires unto God, in the name of Christ, for things agreeable to his will." [SC 98] Desire itself is not prayer, but the expression of our desires to God, is the essence</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='147'>147</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">of prayer. In this there are several things to be considered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">When there is strong desire, there is a feeling of want. Man has nothing for which he is not dependent. He needs many things for the welfare and comfort of his body. These wants are supplied by the beneficent dispensations of divine providence. For these blessings he is permitted to ask: "Give us day by day our daily bread." [<a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/Luke/011.html#003' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/011/003.html' target='xr'>11:3</a>] As to the extent of earthly blessings, he should ask only for what is necessary, and may be for his own good, and the glory of God. When deprived of health or other temporal blessings, he may seek for deliverance and for a restoration of such <a href='../../../rf/gl/f.html#favours' target='gl'>favours</a> as have been withheld; but as it is good to be afflicted, he should rather pray to have his sufferings sanctified, than removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">But our prayers should be chiefly offered for spiritual blessings, for ourselves and others. Here, we cannot be too importunate. We are taught, indeed, that it is importunity in prayer, which secures the blessing. This includes earnestness and perseverance. We should pray and not faint; be instant in prayer; yea, pray without ceasing. Prayer, to the spiritual life, is like breathing to the life of the body. We cannot live without prayer. Our prayers should not be confined to ourselves and our immediate <a name='g10020' href='../../../rf/gl/c.html#connexions' target='gl'>connexions</a>. These may properly hold a first place in our petitions; but we are bound to pray for rulers, and for all that are in authority, and for all sorts of men, that God would be merciful to them, and show them his salvation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Prayer should be in the name of Christ. Faith is absolutely necessary in acceptable prayer, and faith always has respect to the Mediator. The humble penitent feels that he is unworthy to approach the</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='148'>148</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">throne of God in his own name, for he is defiled with sin. He can only come with liberty and confidence, when he beholds his great High Priest standing between him and the divine Majesty. The prayers of believers are rendered acceptable and efficacious, only through the intercession of Jesus Christ our advocate. This is the precious incense, which is offered with the prayers of all saints.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">But faith has respect also to the promises of God. On these it firmly relies, believing that what He hath said, he will faithfully perform. The person who prays in faith, confidently expects to receive whatever God has promised to give, in answer to prayer. Christians should therefore watch for the answer to their petitions. They should be attentive to the <a name='g10030' href='../../../rf/gl/p.html#providences' target='gl'>providences</a> of God, by which prayer is often answered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Prayer was never intended to supersede the use of other means; effort should always follow our prayers. The more faithfully we <a href='../../../rf/gl/l.html#labour' target='gl'>labour</a>, the better reason have we to expect an answer to prayer.</p>
