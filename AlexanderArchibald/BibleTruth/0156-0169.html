<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">This subject is intimately connected with the assurance of salvation. For if true believers may lose their faith, and totally and finally fall away, then, manifestly, there can be no such thing as assurance of salvation. A person may know assuredly that he is a child of God, and at present free from all condemnation; but upon this hypothesis, he cannot possibly be assured that he will continue in this happy state. In the exercise of his own free will, he may depart from God, renounce Christ and become a reprobate. If this doctrine be admitted, that all saints are liable to apostatize, and that there is no such thing promised as the grace of perseverance, then Paul's declarations, in which he expresses the fullest confidence that he should possess a crown of life, must be understood conditionally; provided he should persevere to the end. And in the same manner we must construe</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='157'>157</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">those triumphant expressions at <a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/Rom/008.html#038' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/008/038.html' target='xr'>8:38</a>-39. "For I am persuaded, that neither life nor death, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." According to this theory, we must understand the apostle to mean, that if he continued in the faith, none of these things should be able to separate him from the love of God in Christ Jesus. But who knows, whether Paul did persevere to the end? Who knows, but that his faith failed in the last extremity? We have no account, in the New Testament, of the circumstances of his death. Indeed, if the standing of believers depends on themselves, it would not be surprising, that any one should be overcome by temptation, and should finally fall from a state of grace. It is possible, then, that all the apostles might have fallen away in the time of persecution; for although Christ promises to go and prepare a place for them, and that they should sit on thrones in his kingdom, yet all this must be understood on condition they persevered to the end!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Those who maintain, that all true believers will certainly persevere, do not ground their opinion on any ability which any of them have to stand. Left to themselves, they believe, that all of them would be sure to apostatize.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">They attribute perseverance in grace, as they do the first conversion of the soul, to the love of God. They believe that the same power which brings the soul from death to life, is able to preserve it in life; and that the gifts and callings of God are without repentance, that is, without change of purpose.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Again, as believers are intimately and spiritually united to Christ, so as to be members of his mystical body, and since in virtue of this union, they receive continual supplies of grace and strength as they need these blessings, they are of opinion, that Christ the Head, will never suffer any member actually united to Him, to be severed from his body and to perish for ever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Surely the Spirit of all grace which dwells in believers, is sufficient to keep up that spiritual life which He has generated in them; and is able to keep them from the danger of <a href='../../../rf/gl/a.html#apostacy' target='gl'>apostacy</a>; and if He can do it, he will do it; for whom he loves, he loves to the end.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Those whose names are written in heaven, in the Lamb's Book of Life, before the foundation of the world, will at last reach heaven. The kingdom which the saints shall inherit, was prepared for them before the foundation of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Not one link of Paul's glorious chain of salvation can be broken. "Whom He did <a name='g10020' href='../../../rf/gl/f.html#foreknow' target='gl'>foreknow</a>, them he did <a name='g10030' href='../../../rf/gl/p.html#predestinate' target='gl'>predestinate</a> to be conformed to the image of his Son, and whom he <a name='g10040' href='../../../rf/gl/p.html#predestinated' target='gl'>predestinated</a>, them he also called, and whom he called, he glorified." [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/Rom/008.html#029' target='kj'>Rom</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rom/008/029.html' target='xr'>8:29</a>-30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The apostle Paul was confident that He who had begun a good work in the Philippians would perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Can it be believed, that the same love and power which <a name='g10050' href='../../../rf/gl/e.html#effectually' target='gl'>effectually</a> called believers from their death in sin, will not preserve them in a state of spiritual life when it has been commenced?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">In the days of the apostles there were many apostates; but John, in <a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/1John/002.html#019' target='kj'>1 John</a> <a href='../../../xr/1John/002/019.html' target='xr'>2:19</a>, clearly teaches, that such had never been sincere Christians. "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they no doubt would have continued</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">with us; but they went out that it might be made manifest, that they were not all of us."</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">And the apostle Paul, in <a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/2Tim/002.html#019' target='kj'>2 Tim</a> <a href='../../../xr/2Tim/002/019.html' target='xr'>2:19</a>, treating of the success of heretics in subverting the faith of some; that is, seducing them to embrace false doctrines; will by no means agree, that these persons who were thus led astray, or their teachers, had ever belonged to the foundation of God, or were among his approved people; for he says, "Nevertheless, the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his."</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">But it is said, by the <a name='g10060' href='../../../rf/gl/i.html#impugners' target='gl'>impugners</a> of this doctrine, that though God will not forsake his people, yet they may forsake Him; that the promises are made to the people of God, but when they cease to be his people, they cut themselves off from the blessings of the covenant of grace, which are all conditional, and made to <i>believers</i>. Now, we admit, that if any should cease to believe, they would be thus cut off; but what we maintain is, that their faith shall never fail. If God has made promises to this effect, then they are safe. Well, we know that Christ by his intercession did keep Peter's faith from utterly failing; for He said, "I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not." [<a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/Luke/022.html#032' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/022/032.html' target='xr'>22:32</a>] And his intercessions were not only for Peter and the apostles, but for all who should through their word believe on his name. And in <a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/Jer/032.html#040' target='kj'>Jer</a> <a href='../../../xr/Jer/032/040.html' target='xr'>32:40</a>, we find an explicit promise, and solemn covenant, in which God engages to preserve his people from falling: "And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good." This seems to be a very full promise, and a covenant in all things well-ordered and sure: but this is not all: He immediately adds, "And I will put my fear in their hearts, <i>that they shall</i></p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='160'>160</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><i>not depart from me</i>." And this seems to be implied, when He promised, "I will put my laws in their mind, and write them in their hearts." [<a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/Heb/008.html#010' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/008/010.html' target='xr'>8:10</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">In <a name='s10070' href='../../../kj/John/010.html#000' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/010/000.html' target='xr'>10</a>, our blessed Lord speaks of himself as the good Shepherd. And he gives as the chief characteristic of a good shepherd, that he loves his sheep. And in his own case, his love was so great, that he was willing to lay down his life for the sheep. And he informs us, that those who were truly of the number of his sheep would hear his voice and follow him, while they would not hear the voice of strangers. His attention to the flock as their Shepherd, was so kind and compassionate, that he calls each one by his name and goes before the sheep, and leads them in the right way. From this description it might be inferred, that Christ would not forsake those on whom he had set his love; and that he would not suffer their enemies to carry them off. Those persons who were specially the purchase of his blood and his dying agonies, he would certainly be disposed to save from perdition. There can be no doubt of the desire of the great Shepherd, that these objects of his love, and for whom he had paid a price above all estimation, should not perish. But we are not left to our own inferences on this subject. Our blessed Lord has anticipated our conclusions, by his clear and positive declarations. His gracious words should never be forgotten. "My sheep hear my voice, and they know me, and follow me. And I give unto them eternal life; <i>and they shall never perish</i>, nor shall any pluck them out of my hand. My Father which gave them me, is greater than all; and none is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand."

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">language. It must be evident, that if God is able to keep them from perishing, they will be saved. And who will dare to call in question the ability of Christ and his Father, to preserve whom he will, from apostatizing? Surely God is able to cause even the weakest of them to stand. Suppose the contrary; suppose that one of these given by the Father to his only begotten Son to be redeemed, should be overcome by Satan the enemy of God and his people, and should perish eternally. What a triumph to the grand adversary, and what a dishonour to the Redeemer! Shall it ever be said, in the world of <a href='../../../rf/gl/w.html#wo' target='gl'>wo</a>, 'Here is one of the beloved of God—one specially given to the Son—one purchased with the blood of the Son of God—one raised from the death of sin by the power of his Spirit—one that heard his voice, loved and followed Him,—such an one is eternally lost! The Saviour was not able to preserve this soul from falling under the power of temptation. Satan in this contest gained the victory, and tore away one of Christ's beloved sheep—yea, dismembered his mystical body; for this soul, now damned, was once a member of the body of Christ.' Reader, can you believe this? Do not these arguments convince you that such a thing as this never can occur?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Again, does not Christ appear in heaven, as the Advocate of his people? And does not the Father hear him always? And shall not his intercessions be effectual to obtain persevering grace for all those whose cause he pleads? "He is able to save to the uttermost all that come unto God by Him; seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them." [<a name='s10090' href='../../../kj/Heb/007.html#025' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/007/025.html' target='xr'>7:25</a>] It is the continual intercession of Christ which preserves his disciples from falling away totally and finally. Peter in his self-confidence fell into an enormous and disgraceful sin; and if he had</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='162'>162</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">been left to himself, Satan would undoubtedly have overcome him and ruined him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">And that Christ intercedes for believers as he does not for others, we learn from that remarkable intercessory prayer, which he offered before he left the world. "I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them, which thou hast given me; for they are thine. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them. While I was in the world, I kept them in thy name; those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, except the son of perdition." [<a name='s10100' href='../../../kj/John/017.html#012' target='kj'>John</a> <a href='../../../xr/John/017/012.html' target='xr'>17:12</a>] Those who oppose the doctrine which we defend, think that in this last clause, the nerves of the argument drawn from this passage, are cut; and that as Judas was one of those given to Christ by his Father, and he perished, therefore believers may eternally perish. But can any impartial, intelligent Christian believe, that Judas was really included in the number of those given to Christ by the Father, and for whom he prayed? This construction would not only be <a href='../../../rf/gl/d.html#dishonourable' target='gl'>dishonourable</a> to Christ, but it would destroy the force and consistency of all that Christ uttered in this remarkable prayer. If Christ prayed not for the world, how came he to pray for Judas, who was a thief, and covetous from the time of his being first called to be an apostle? And Christ had perfect knowledge of his hypocrisy. And if he specially prayed for him, as much as for the other disciples, how came it to pass, that this prayer, in his case, was ineffectual? And if his special intercessions may be ineffectual, what solid ground have we to trust in him, and why was it declared that the Father hears him always? But it will be asked, how we get over the difficulty which this clause presents. If the original Greek be construed agreeably to the</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='163'>163</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">common usage of the language, there will remain no difficulty. The sentence is elliptical, and the true import undoubtedly is, And none of them is lost: but the son of perdition is lost, who was not of the number given. The very same construction is used, where our Lord says, "There were many widows in Israel in the days of Eliseus, but to none of them was he sent, but unto a widow of Sarepta." [<a name='s10110' href='../../../kj/Luke/004.html#025' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/004/025.html' target='xr'>4:25</a>-26] The <i>but</i> here excludes the widow of Sarepta, for she was not a widow of Israel, but belonged to the Canaanitish nation. And in the same <a href='../../../rf/gl/c.html#connexion' target='gl'>connexion</a>, "For there were many lepers in Israel, in the days of Eliseus, but to none of them was he sent, but unto Naaman the Syrian." <a name='s10120' href='../../../kj/Luke/004.html#027' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/004/027.html' target='xr'>4:27</a>. Naaman was not one of the lepers of Israel, but a man of a foreign nation, just as Judas was not one whom the Saviour had kept, but was the son of perdition. This text, therefore, properly understood, furnishes no objection whatever, to the doctrine of the saints' perseverance, derived from this intercessory prayer of our Lord. And this prayer alone affords an impregnable foundation for this precious doctrine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">It is hard to believe, that those whose names were written in the Lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world, shall utterly and eternally perish. It is, indeed, promised to the saints of the church of Sardis, that their names shall not be blotted out of the book of life; and it is reasonable to think that the same promise is applicable to all true believers. If these names might be blotted out, there would be no great cause of rejoicing that they were written in heaven; but our Lord teaches his disciples to rejoice in this, above all things. (<a name='s10130' href='../../../kj/Luke/010.html#020' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/010/020.html' target='xr'>10:20</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">It is indeed said, "That if any one shall take away from the words of this prophecy, God will take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='164'>164</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">city, and from the things written in this book." <a name='s10140' href='../../../kj/Rev/022.html#019' target='kj'>Rev</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rev/022/019.html' target='xr'>22:19</a>. The meaning is not that such a person ever had any part in this book, but that he never should have. It is not said, that the names of such were written in the book of life; but it is declared that it was a privilege of which they should never partake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">There is one view of this subject which I have not seen given by the authors which I have consulted. All accountable creatures are placed, when created, in a state of probation. When this probation is ended, they are confirmed in a state of holiness and happiness, and are never more exposed to any peril of their eternal life. Thus, when a part of the angels fell, the remaining hosts were confirmed, and are therefore called "elect angels." [<a name='s10150' href='../../../kj/1Tim/005.html#021' target='kj'>1 Tim</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Tim/005/021.html' target='xr'>5:21</a>] Whether they stood by their own inherent strength, or whether some gratuitous aid was afforded to them, which was not granted to those who fell, as some suppose, we cannot certainly tell. But all seem to be agreed, that the holy angels are exposed now to no danger of perishing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">In the case of mankind, if our federal head and representative had retained his innocence and finished his obedience, even to the end of the time appointed for his trial, it seems to be agreed by most, that there would have been no trial of each individual, but all the race would have been brought into existence in a justified state; not only in a state of innocence, but in a state of confirmed holiness, and liable to no danger of sinning or perishing. Now since the second Adam, the Representative and Surety of his chosen seed, has rendered a complete righteousness to the law, when the same is imputed to his people for their justification, will they not stand at least in as safe a condition, as they would have been in, had their first representative fulfilled the condition of the covenant</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='165'>165</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">of works? It appears reasonable to think, that no justified persons ever can fall away: that is, God is engaged to grant them eternal life, and has covenanted to prevent them, by his confirming grace, from falling into sin and ruin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Adam before he sinned was not in a justified state, though in a state of innocence, because his probation was not yet ended. So also we suppose, that the fallen angels were never in a justified state; they fell also before their probation was finished. We know of no instance of a justified person ever perishing. And as believers are perfectly justified in Christ, they are no longer on probation for life; that is finished, and, therefore, they are included in the bonds of a covenant so well ordered, and so sure, that they can never perish.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Again, the sins of penitent believers are fully and absolutely pardoned; and it is promised that these sins shall be forever buried, and blotted out. But suppose one of these pardoned sinners to fall away from a state of grace, what will be his condition, in regard to the innumerable transgressions already pardoned? Will the guilt of these be laid upon the apostate, or not?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">They who maintain the doctrine that true believers may finally fall away and perish, do also hold that God does all he consistently can to preserve them from apostatizing, and sincerely desires to bring them to the possession of eternal life. Now, I would ask, how is this consistent with acknowledged facts? Some Christians, while in the world, are exposed to much greater temptations than others. As God <a name='g10100' href='../../../rf/gl/f.html#foreknew' target='gl'>foreknew</a> that certain persons would be unable to resist certain temptations by which they are supposed to be overcome, and caused finally to perish, why were they not by the divine providence preserved from such exposure?</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='166'>166</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">But this is not all: some Christians are called away by death soon after their conversion, and their salvation is secured; while others are left to be buffeted or seduced by temptations for many years, by which they are finally overcome, and are lost. Now if these had been taken out of the world at as early a period of their Christian pilgrimage as the former, they would also have been saved. Where is the impartiality of which so much is said, in relation to these?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">This doctrine has been opposed on the principle that the belief of it tends to breed presumption, and to encourage negligence, in working out our salvation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">We do not assert that this doctrine has never been abused by unholy men: but what doctrine may not be thus abused? Certainly none more so, than the love and mercy of God. In answer to this objection, we would observe, that our doctrine is the perseverance of the saints in <i>faith</i> and <i>holiness</i>. Just so far as any professor fails in the exercise of faith, and practice of holiness, he loses the evidence that he is a true Christian. According to this view of the subject, he never can persuade himself that he will persevere, unless he is in the exercise of grace, without which he cannot possess the evidences of being a true believer. Again, fear is not the only, nor the most efficacious motive which urges the Christian to activity and energy in running the gospel race. Hope has more influence on him, than fear; and when his hope of final success arises to assurance, he is animated with the liveliest zeal, and impelled by the strongest motives, to lay aside every weight, and run with patience the race set before him. And this is consonant with experience in temporal matters. Suppose a man to have in prospect a journey, through a very difficult</p>

If he could be assured, before setting out, that however many obstacles and enemies he should encounter, yet he would certainly reach the end of his journey, and come off triumphantly, how would such assurance encourage his heart, and nerve his body to go on courageously! whereas, if he entertained but small hope of success, discouragement would weaken all his efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">It is acknowledged there are some texts of Scripture, which viewed separately, seem to teach that true believers may fall from a state of grace; but the doctrine is so contrary to the great principles of the covenant of grace, that such an interpretation of any text as would favour it, cannot consistently with the analogy of divine truth be admitted. We must compare scripture with scripture, and thus endeavour to ascertain the mind of the Spirit. The apparent testimony of some texts of Scripture in favour of the <a href='../../../rf/gl/a.html#apostacy' target='gl'>apostacy</a> of believers, led Augustin to adopt the opinion, that some persons, not of the number of the elect, were really converted; but that such never persevered to the end, but fell from the gracious state to which they had attained. He firmly maintained, however, that none of the elect could perish. Probably this opinion was adopted by Luther and some of his followers. And some few have believed, that though the saints might for a season fall totally away, which they suppose must have been the case with David, Solomon and Peter; yet they are always recovered, and never finally apostatize. It is not necessary to make any remarks on this opinion, as it has been held by few. There are no instances in Scripture of the final fall of real saints. To such professors as will be found at the left hand of the Judge at the last day, it will be said, however great their gifts, or high their</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The texts of Scripture which seem to favour the final <a href='../../../rf/gl/a.html#apostacy' target='gl'>apostacy</a> of real Christians, we have not time nor space, to consider in detail. We think, however, that they may all be explained in consistency with the true doctrine, upon one or other of the following principles. First, that the persons spoken of as righteous, or as believers, are described according to the opinion which they entertained of themselves, and the profession which they made; or secondly, that the cases are hypothetical, not declaring that, in fact any should fall away; but stating what would be the consequence if such an event should take place: or thirdly, that the cases described are of those who under the external light of divine revelation, and under the common influences of the Holy Spirit, had advanced far in the doctrinal knowledge of Christianity, and had experienced lively impressions from the truth, without having undergone a radical change of heart. Such a case is described by our Saviour, in the parable of the <a name='g10130' href='../../../rf/gl/s.html#sower' target='gl'>sower</a>, in regard to such as are represented by the seed which fell on stony ground; such as hear the word with joy, and for a season, give pleasing evidence of piety; but having <i>no root in themselves</i>, in the time of temptation fall away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">And to the above cases, we may add that of those, who in apostolic times, received the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost; for these were not conferred only on real Christians, as we know from the case of Judas, and from the account given by our Lord, of the plea which will be made by some whom he will condemn at the last day. They are represented as saying, "Have we not in thy name cast out devils, and</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">But surely it never can be, that one of those who were chosen in Christ, before the foundation of the world, and in time <a name='g10140' href='../../../rf/gl/e.html#effectually' target='gl'>effectually</a> called, and united to Christ, so as to become living members of his mystical body; and whose sins he bore on the cross, and to whom he has promised the constant indwelling of the Holy Spirit, and whose names are in the book of life, should be finally lost. The enemy of God and man shall never, in the dark dominions over which he reigns, have it in his power, triumphantly to boast, that he has plucked from the hands of the great Shepherd one of the dear lambs of his flock. No: the elect of God can not be deceived to their ruin. Those whose names are in the book of life shall never be cast into outer darkness. "<i>They shall never perish</i>."
