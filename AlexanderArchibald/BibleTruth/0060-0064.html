<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">Although reason cannot assure us, that there are in the universe creatures of an order superior to man; yet all analogy is favourable to such a doctrine. As we find that below the human race, there is a gradation of animated beings, down to the lowest forms of organized life, it would be strange indeed, if the infinite space above man should be entirely unoccupied. And as the Deity is a pure spirit, without bodily parts, it would seem reasonable to think, that he has made some species of creatures, of a purely spiritual essence. These remarks are made, because Rationalists are generally disposed to deny the real existence of angels; whereas, professing to be guided by reason, they ought readily to receive this doctrine, which is so clearly revealed in the Bible. It may properly be mentioned here, that Jews, <a name='g10010' href='../../../rf/gl/m.html#mohammedans' target='gl'>Mohammedans</a>, and Pagans, all concur in believing in a species of creatures of nobler capacities than belong to the human race. This almost universal agreement, is probably derived from ancient tradition; but if from the suggestions of reason, it is still favourable to the doctrine of Scripture, on this subject.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The word translated <i>angel</i> properly means, <i>a messenger</i>. It is, therefore, frequently applied to human beings, in which cases it is literally translated <i>messenger</i>. And not only so, but we have abundant</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">proof, that the word is also used to designate the Son of God, the angel that appeared to Abraham, and is expressly called Jehovah; also, the same that spoke to Moses from the burning bush, and said, I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; who is also called an angel. This is the angel who led the Israelites through the wilderness by a fiery pillar and protecting cloud, and often appeared to them in glory, at the tabernacle. This was the angel, in whom was "the name of Jehovah," and who is called by Malachi, "the messenger," or "angel of the Covenant." [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/Mal/003.html#001' target='kj'>Mal</a> <a href='../../../xr/Mal/003/001.html' target='xr'>3:1</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Many theologians have also maintained, that Michael the Archangel was not a created being, but the Son of God; for this opinion, however, the reasons are not conclusive: yet there is no propriety in speaking of archangels, for only one is ever mentioned in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">There can be no doubt that angels are created beings, although we are not informed when they were brought into existence. It is probable, however, that the whole universe, with all the various species of beings, was produced at once, since the whole appears to form one grand system. But we must not pretend to be wise above what is written.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Angels are moral agents and accountable beings, or they could not be holy, and could not have sinned, as many of them have done. They were doubtless, placed when created, in a state of probation, as man was. Indeed, every rational creature, made under a moral law, is naturally in a state of probation; that is, obedience is required of him, and a reward promised, and a penalty threatened in case of disobedience. All creatures are mutable, and, therefore, all creatures, however exalted, are capable of sinning when left to themselves. Unless God, in infinite kindness and condescension,</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='62'>62</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">limited the period of probation, it would last forever; as forever, the creature left to himself would be liable to sin: but it has pleased the goodness of God to limit the probation of his moral subjects to a certain period, probably short, after which, those who stand the trial and retain their integrity, are confirmed in a state of immutable holiness and happiness. Those angels who kept their first estate, and resisted the temptation by which many of their companions were seduced from their allegiance, are not only called "holy angels," [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/Matt/025.html#031' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/025/031.html' target='xr'>25:31</a>; <a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/Mark/008.html#038' target='kj'>Mark</a> <a href='../../../xr/Mark/008/038.html' target='xr'>8:38</a>; <a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/Luke/009.html#026' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/009/026.html' target='xr'>9:26</a>; <a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/Rev/014.html#010' target='kj'>Rev</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rev/014/010.html' target='xr'>14:10</a>] but "elect angels." [<a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/1Tim/005.html#021' target='kj'>1 Tim</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Tim/005/021.html' target='xr'>5:21</a>] What proportion of the number fell is not revealed; though the <a name='g10020' href='../../../rf/gl/r.html#romanists' target='gl'>Romanists</a> pretend to determine this and many other points, for which they have no authority from Scripture. The number of good angels, we know, is very great. Christ said, that he could pray to his Father, and he would send to his aid more than twelve legions of angels; which would be more than seventy thousand. And at the birth of our Saviour, there were present with the Shepherds, a great multitude of the heavenly host. And in the book of Daniel and of the Revelation, we read of "thousands of thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand." [<a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/Rev/005.html#011' target='kj'>Rev</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rev/005/011.html' target='xr'>5:11</a>] And in <a name='s10070' href='../../../kj/Heb/012.html#022' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/012/022.html' target='xr'>12:22</a>, the apostle speaks of "an innumerable company of angels."</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">They are possessed of wisdom and intelligence superior to that of man, and continually contemplate the divine glory as manifested in the work of creation; and especially, in the work of redemption. "Which things," says Peter, "the angels desire to look into." [<a name='s10080' href='../../../kj/1Pet/001.html#012' target='kj'>1 Pet</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Pet/001/012.html' target='xr'>1:12</a>] And in the Revelation of John, they are represented as encircling the throne of the Almighty, and ascribing unto Him that sitteth on the throne and to the Lamb, "power, and riches, and wisdom, and honour, and glory, and blessing." [<a name='s10090' href='../../../kj/Rev/005.html#012' target='kj'>Rev</a> <a href='../../../xr/Rev/005/012.html' target='xr'>5:12</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">That the angels are guardians of the children of God,</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='63'>63</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">is clearly taught in the Holy Scriptures. "The angel of the Lord encampeth around them that fear Him and delivereth them. (<a name='s10100' href='../../../kj/Ps/039.html#007' target='kj'>Ps</a> <a href='../../../xr/Ps/039/007.html' target='xr'>39:7</a>.) "For He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone." (<a name='s10110' href='../../../kj/Ps/091.html#011' target='kj'>Ps</a> <a href='../../../xr/Ps/091/011.html' target='xr'>91:11</a>-12.) And it seems to be intimated by our Saviour that particular angels have the charge of individuals; for when speaking of children that believe, he says, "Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones, for I say unto you, that in heaven, their angels do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven." (<a name='s10120' href='../../../kj/Matt/018.html#010' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/018/010.html' target='xr'>18:10</a>.) But whether every saint has an angel to attend him alone, is not revealed, and the thing is not probable: for <a href='../../../rf/gl/a.html#aught' target='gl'>aught</a> we know, one guardian angel may be sufficient for many individuals. Neither is it necessary to suppose, that guardian angels are always present with their wards: it is sufficient that they frequently visit them. And it would seem clear from Scripture, that all the holy angels are occupied in this service; for, in the epistle to the Hebrews, we read, "Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister to them who shall be heirs of salvation?" (<a name='s10130' href='../../../kj/Heb/001.html#014' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/001/014.html' target='xr'>1:14</a>.) The <a name='g10040' href='../../../rf/gl/r.html#romanists' target='gl'>Romanists</a>, indeed, confine this ministry to the very lowest of the nine orders of their celestial hierarchy; but for their doctrine, they have no solid foundation, and it is refuted by the declaration of our Lord, already quoted, that the guardian angels of the little ones who believe, do always behold the face of God in heaven. These must, therefore, be of the highest order; and the word <i>angels</i>, in the New Testament, is a general term, comprehending all orders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">This leads us at once to the inquiry, whether there are different ranks and orders of good angels. While</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='64'>64</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">we reject the hierarchy of the <a name='g10050' href='../../../rf/gl/r.html#romish' target='gl'>Romish</a> priests, which has no foundation in Scripture, we cannot but admit, that according to the testimony of Paul, there are several ranks, or orders of angels, but how they differ from one another, we cannot tell. All we know is, that the names by which they are designated and distinguished, import high station and great power and dignity. They are called, "thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers;" but exalted as they are, the Son of God is declared to be their Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">As the word "angel" signifies a messenger, some are of opinion, that the "spirits of the just made perfect" [<a name='s10140' href='../../../kj/Heb/012.html#023' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/012/023.html' target='xr'>12:23</a>] may be of the number employed in missions to the earth; and especially as guardians. But nothing of this kind can be learned from the Sacred Scriptures.</p>
