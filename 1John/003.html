<a name='001' href='../../xr/1John/003/001.html' target='xr'>1.</a> Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.<br>
<a name='002' href='../../xr/1John/003/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1John/003/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1John/003/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1John/003/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.<br>
<a name='006' href='../../xr/1John/003/006.html' target='xr'>6.</a> Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.<br>
<a name='007' href='../../xr/1John/003/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1John/003/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1John/003/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1John/003/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1John/003/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1John/003/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> Not as Cain, <i>who</i> was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.<br>
<a name='013' href='../../xr/1John/003/013.html' target='xr'>13.</a> Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.<br>
<a name='014' href='../../xr/1John/003/014.html' target='xr'>14.</a> We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not <i>his</i> brother abideth in death.<br>
<a name='015' href='../../xr/1John/003/015.html' target='xr'>15.</a> Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.<br>
<a name='016' href='../../xr/1John/003/016.html' target='xr'>16.</a> Hereby perceive we the love <i>of God</i>, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down <i>our</i> lives for the brethren.<br>
<a name='017' href='../../xr/1John/003/017.html' target='xr'>17.</a> But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels <i>of compassion</i> from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?<br>
<a name='018' href='../../xr/1John/003/018.html' target='xr'>18.</a> My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.<br>
<a name='019' href='../../xr/1John/003/019.html' target='xr'>19.</a> And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.<br>
<a name='020' href='../../xr/1John/003/020.html' target='xr'>20.</a> For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.<br>
<a name='021' href='../../xr/1John/003/021.html' target='xr'>21.</a> Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, <i>then</i> have we confidence toward God.<br>
<a name='022' href='../../xr/1John/003/022.html' target='xr'>22.</a> And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.<br>
<a name='023' href='../../xr/1John/003/023.html' target='xr'>23.</a> And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.<br>
<a name='024' href='../../xr/1John/003/024.html' target='xr'>24.</a> And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.<br>
