<a name='001' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/001.html' target='xr'>1.</a> And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; <i>there was</i> no open vision.<br>
<a name='002' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> And it came to pass at that time, when Eli <i>was</i> laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, <i>that</i> he could not see;<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God <i>was</i>, and Samuel was laid down <i>to sleep</i>;<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here <i>am</i> I.<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here <i>am</i> I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.<br>
<a name='006' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/006.html' target='xr'>6.</a> And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here <i>am</i> I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.<br>
<a name='007' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here <i>am</i> I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> In that day I will perform against Eli all <i>things</i> which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.<br>
<a name='013' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/013.html' target='xr'>13.</a> For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.<br>
<a name='014' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/014.html' target='xr'>14.</a> And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.<br>
<a name='015' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/015.html' target='xr'>15.</a> And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.<br>
<a name='016' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/016.html' target='xr'>16.</a> Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here <i>am</i> I.<br>
<a name='017' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/017.html' target='xr'>17.</a> And he said, What <i>is</i> the thing that <i>the LORD</i> hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide <i>it</i> not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide <i>any</i> thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.<br>
<a name='018' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/018.html' target='xr'>18.</a> And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It <i>is</i> the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.<br>
<a name='019' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/019.html' target='xr'>19.</a> And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.<br>
<a name='020' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/020.html' target='xr'>20.</a> And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel <i>was</i> established <i>to be</i> a prophet of the LORD.<br>
<a name='021' href='../../xr/1Sam/003/021.html' target='xr'>21.</a> And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.<br>
