<p align="center" style="text-align:center" class="msonormal"><span style="letter-spacing:1.0pt">REPENTANCE TOWARD GOD AND FAITH IN OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">Paul gives "repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ," [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/Acts/020.html#021' target='kj'>Acts</a> <a href='../../../xr/Acts/020/021.html' target='xr'>20:21</a>] as a summary of his preaching, during his two years' ministry at Ephesus; and, as comprehending the whole counsel of God, and as including whatever was profitable to the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Repentance literally signifies a change of mind for the better; but, in our Shorter Catechism, it is defined to be, "A saving grace, whereby a sinner out of a true sense of his sin, and apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ, doth, with grief and hatred of his sin, turn from it unto God, with full purpose of and endeavour after new obedience." [SC 87] And in the same place, faith is defined to be, "A saving grace, whereby we receive and rest upon him (Jesus Christ) for salvation as he is freely offered in the gospel." [SC 86] Whatever difference of opinion there may be as to the precise meaning of these scriptural terms, all sound Christians will admit, that for popular and practical use, no language could be selected which would more perspicuously and properly convey to the reader a true notion of these fundamental graces. And, as to the precedence of one before the other, it is a question as impertinent, as whether a whole precedes one of its parts, or is preceded by it. No man can give a sound definition of evangelical repentance which will not include faith. But, if the word repentance</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='132'>132</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">be used in a more restricted sense, for godly sorrow for sin and hatred of it, it must be preceded by a true faith, for seeing in a rational mind goes before feeling. There must be a perception of the holiness of the divine law, before the turpitude of sin can be so seen as to occasion hatred of it, and grief on account of it. But, if by faith be meant that cordial reception of Christ, which is mentioned in the words cited from the Catechism, then, certainly, there must be some true sense of sin, before we can appreciate Christ as a Saviour from sin. But, it is altogether wrong to perplex the minds of serious Christians with useless questions of this sort. Let the <a name='g10010' href='../../../rf/gl/s.html#schoolmen' target='gl'>schoolmen</a> discuss such matters to their heart's content, but let the humble Christian rest in the plain and obvious meaning of the words of Scripture. The effect of divine truth on the heart is produced by general views, and not by nice and metaphysical distinctions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Both faith and repentance must be proved to be genuine by their fruits. "Faith works by love and purifies the heart." [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/Gal/005.html#006' target='kj'>Gal</a> <a href='../../../xr/Gal/005/006.html' target='xr'>5:6</a>; <a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/Heb/010.html#022' target='kj'>Heb</a> <a href='../../../xr/Heb/010/022.html' target='xr'>10:22</a>] "Faith overcomes the world." [<a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/1John/005.html#004' target='kj'>1 John</a> <a href='../../../xr/1John/005/004.html' target='xr'>5:4</a>] James says, "show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works." [<a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/James/002.html#018' target='kj'>James</a> <a href='../../../xr/James/002/018.html' target='xr'>2:18</a>] Repentance is itself a turning from sin unto God. It is the commencement of a reformation from all sin. John the Baptist, when he inculcated repentance, at the same time called upon the people "to bring forth fruits meet for repentance." [<a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/Matt/003.html#008' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/003/008.html' target='xr'>3:8</a>] Repentance is no atonement for sin; but it is <a name='g10020' href='../../../rf/gl/i.html#indissolubly' target='gl'>indissolubly</a> connected with the pardon of sin. Therefore it was said, "Repent and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out." [<a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/Acts/003.html#019' target='kj'>Acts</a> <a href='../../../xr/Acts/003/019.html' target='xr'>3:19</a>]</p>
