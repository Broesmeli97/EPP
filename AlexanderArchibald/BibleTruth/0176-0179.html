<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">When Christ celebrated the passover for the last time with his disciples, at the close of the feast, he instituted another sacrament, bearing a strong analogy to this Jewish festival, to be perpetually observed in his church until he should come again. While they were reclining around the table, he took of the bread which remained and blessed it and brake it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "This is my body which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me. Likewise also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you." [<a name='s10000' href='../../../kj/Luke/022.html#020' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/022/020.html' target='xr'>22:20</a>] As this ordinance was intended to be social, that is, to be celebrated by the church when assembled, Paul calls it a communion; "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?" [<a name='s10010' href='../../../kj/1Cor/010.html#016' target='kj'>1 Cor</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Cor/010/016.html' target='xr'>10:16</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">Nothing can be plainer than the nature of the duty enjoined upon the disciples, and intended to be obligatory on all Christians to the end of the world; for the apostle Paul, who was not present at the institution of the <a name='g10010' href='../../../rf/gl/e.html#eucharist' target='gl'>eucharist</a>, but received it, as he did the gospel, by immediate revelation, when he recites the words of institution, adds an important clause, "For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show forth the Lord's death till he come." [<a name='s10020' href='../../../kj/1Cor/011.html#026' target='kj'>1 Cor</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Cor/011/026.html' target='xr'>11:26</a>] From</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">which it is evident, that it was intended to be a standing memorial of the death of Christ until his second advent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">When Christ says, "this is my body," [<a name='s10030' href='../../../kj/Matt/026.html#026' target='kj'>Matt</a> <a href='../../../xr/Matt/026/026.html' target='xr'>26:26</a>; <a name='s10040' href='../../../kj/Mark/014.html#022' target='kj'>Mark</a> <a href='../../../xr/Mark/014/022.html' target='xr'>14:22</a>; <a name='s10050' href='../../../kj/Luke/022.html#019' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/022/019.html' target='xr'>22:19</a>; <a name='s10060' href='../../../kj/1Cor/011.html#024' target='kj'>1 Cor</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Cor/011/024.html' target='xr'>11:24</a>] to suppose that he meant to teach, that the piece of bread which he held in his hand, was literally his material body, is an opinion so monstrous, and involving so many contradictions, that it never could have originated but in a dark and superstitious age. In the first place, it was contradicted by all the senses, for the properties of bread and wine remained after the words were spoken, just the same as before. In all other cases of miracles, the appeal is to the senses: no example can be adduced of men being required to believe any thing contrary to the testimony of their senses. But if the bread which Christ held in his hand was literally his body, he must have had two bodies; and if he partook of the bread, he must have eaten his own body. He says, "This is my body, which is broken for you." [<a name='s10070' href='../../../kj/1Cor/011.html#024' target='kj'>1 Cor</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Cor/011/024.html' target='xr'>11:24</a>] "This is my blood, which is shed for you:" [<a name='s10080' href='../../../kj/Luke/022.html#020' target='kj'>Luke</a> <a href='../../../xr/Luke/022/020.html' target='xr'>22:20</a>] if these words are taken literally, then Christ was already slain, and his blood already shed; he was, therefore, crucified before he was nailed to the cross. Moreover, if the bread is transubstantiated every time this sacrament is celebrated, Christ must have as many bodies as there are officiating priests: and while his body is glorified in heaven, it is offered as a sacrifice on earth, in thousands of different places. And while the glorified body in heaven is no longer composed of flesh and blood, the body made out of the bread and wine, is a real body of flesh containing blood, as when he <a name='g10020' href='../../../rf/gl/t.html#tabernacled' target='gl'>tabernacled</a> among men. And if the thing were possible, what spiritual benefit could be derived, from devouring flesh? From its nature, being material, it could not nourish the spiritual life. And when received</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">into the stomach as food, what becomes of it? is it incorporated, like common food, into our bodies?—But I will not pursue the subject further. Before a man can believe in transubstantiation, he must take leave both of his reason and his senses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The withholding the cup from the laity is an open violation of our Lord's command, and a manifest mutilation of the ordinance; and the pretence for this presumptuous departure from the express command of Christ is both superstitious and impious; for it implies that Christ, in the institution of the cup was wanting in wisdom, or that he was regardless of the danger of having his blood desecrated, by being spilt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">As the Lord's Supper is a memorial of the death of Christ, it should be celebrated often, that this great sacrifice, on which our salvation depends, may not be forgotten, but kept in lively remembrance in the Christian church.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">If it be inquired, in what sense is Christ present in the <a name='g10030' href='../../../rf/gl/e.html#eucharist' target='gl'>eucharist</a>? we answer, spiritually, to those who by faith apprehend and receive him. The idea of a bodily presence in, with, or under the bread and wine, is little less absurd than the doctrine of transubstantiation. Indeed, in some respects, it is even more impossible, for it requires and supposes the ubiquity of Christ's body. The truth then is, that only they who exercise faith in Christ, as exhibited in the <a name='g10040' href='../../../rf/gl/e.html#eucharist' target='gl'>eucharist</a>, eat his flesh and drink his blood. A participation of the instituted signs, without faith to discern the Lord's body, is so far from being beneficial, that it involves the guilt of an awful crime; for "he that eateth and drinketh <a href='../../../rf/gl/u.html#unworthily' target='gl'>unworthily</a>, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself." [<a name='s10090' href='../../../kj/1Cor/011.html#029' target='kj'>1 Cor</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Cor/011/029.html' target='xr'>11:29</a>] He is guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. "Let a man examine himself, therefore,</p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><br style="page-break-before:always" clear="all"></span><p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal"><hr><a href='0000-0000.html' target='kj' name='179'>179</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="msonormal">and so let him eat of this bread and drink of this cup." [<a name='s10100' href='../../../kj/1Cor/011.html#028' target='kj'>1 Cor</a> <a href='../../../xr/1Cor/011/028.html' target='xr'>11:28</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">To make a matter of importance of mere indifferent circumstances in the celebration of the sacraments, has been the cause of useless and hurtful contentions; and to insist on any thing as necessary to a sacrament, which Christ has not expressly enjoined, is a wicked usurpation of his authority, by adding human inventions to divine ordinances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in" class="msonormal">The value of the Lord's Supper is incalculable. It is admirably adapted to our nature. It is simple, and its meaning easily apprehended by the weakest minds. It is strongly significant and impressive. It has been called an epitome of the whole gospel, as the central truths of the system, in which all the rest are implied, are here clearly exhibited. And it ever has been signally blessed to the spiritual edification and comfort of the children of God. They, therefore, who neglect this ordinance, do at the same time, disobey a positive command of Christ, and deprive themselves of one of the richest privileges which can be enjoyed on this side of heaven.</p>
