<a name='001' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/001.html' target='xr'>1.</a> Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.<br>
<a name='002' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/002.html' target='xr'>2.</a> Upon the first <i>day</i> of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as <i>God</i> hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.<br>
<a name='003' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/003.html' target='xr'>3.</a> And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by <i>your</i> letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.<br>
<a name='004' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/004.html' target='xr'>4.</a> And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.<br>
<a name='005' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/005.html' target='xr'>5.</a> Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.<br>
<a name='006' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/006.html' target='xr'>6.</a> And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.<br>
<a name='007' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/007.html' target='xr'>7.</a> For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.<br>
<a name='008' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/008.html' target='xr'>8.</a> But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.<br>
<a name='009' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/009.html' target='xr'>9.</a> For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and <i>there are</i> many adversaries.<br>
<a name='010' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/010.html' target='xr'>10.</a> Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also <i>do</i>.<br>
<a name='011' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/011.html' target='xr'>11.</a> Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.<br>
<a name='012' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/012.html' target='xr'>12.</a> As touching <i>our</i> brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.<br>
<a name='013' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/013.html' target='xr'>13.</a> Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.<br>
<a name='014' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/014.html' target='xr'>14.</a> Let all your things be done with charity.<br>
<a name='015' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/015.html' target='xr'>15.</a> I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and <i>that</i> they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)<br>
<a name='016' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/016.html' target='xr'>16.</a> That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with <i>us</i>, and laboureth.<br>
<a name='017' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/017.html' target='xr'>17.</a> I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.<br>
<a name='018' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/018.html' target='xr'>18.</a> For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.<br>
<a name='019' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/019.html' target='xr'>19.</a> The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.<br>
<a name='020' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/020.html' target='xr'>20.</a> All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.<br>
<a name='021' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/021.html' target='xr'>21.</a> The salutation of <i>me</i> Paul with mine own hand.<br>
<a name='022' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/022.html' target='xr'>22.</a> If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.<br>
<a name='023' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/023.html' target='xr'>23.</a> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with you.<br>
<a name='024' href='../../xr/1Cor/016/024.html' target='xr'>24.</a> My love <i>be</i> with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.<br>
